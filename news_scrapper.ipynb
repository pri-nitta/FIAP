            "Kennedy Johnson was 15 years old when she gave birth to a baby girl in a Detroit foster home for teen moms, in February 1996. Twenty-five years later, when Johnson found herself in northern Ghana being made a queen, she couldn’t quite believe where life had led her. In front of an adoring crowd in Tamale, the largest city in northern Ghana, Johnson was given her honorary title of “Zosimli Naa” in October 2021. It was conferred on her by the Dakpema, Fuseini Bawa, a local spiritual leader, with Zosimli Naa roughly translating as “Friendship Queen” — effectively making her the Dakpema’s head of development in the area. Thousands of miles from home, riding on a horse and dressed in traditional royal attire, Johnson would have been forgiven for thinking she was in a dream. “I’m still pinching myself,” Johnson told CNN. “It feels very surreal.” Johnson’s journey began as a young mother in 1990s Detroit, a time she remembers as “a bit of a challenge.” It’s an understatement. She recalled a relative dropping her off, a pregnant 15-year-old, at the foster home, and promising to pick her up when the child was born. They never returned. “I had to abandon a lot of my childhood goals,” she said. “I just had to dig deep and find some sort of strength.” When her daughter D’Kiya was 11, Johnson started taking her on trips abroad — first to the Bahamas, then Hong Kong, then South America. The pair fell in love with seeing the world, and Johnson began documenting her trips online “to show people that minorities can travel.” “I would meet other people in my age group, but not my demographic,” she said. “I was going places and people would stop me and be like: ‘Beyoncé!’ They would automatically assume I was in the entertainment industry and not taking a holiday, because people of color weren’t really traveling like that.” Years later, once D’Kiya had left home, Johnson took a DNA test that determined that she had Nigerian and Ghanaian heritage. For the first time, her travels took her to West Africa. Her arrival there — which she describes as a “return” — “felt like a huge sigh of relief,” she said. Soon after her first journey, Johnson founded Green Book Travel in 2018, a company that organizes trips to West Africa for members of the diaspora. Named after the annual travel guide that provided Black people with information to keep them safe in Jim Crow America, Green Book Travel takes people to historically significant locations including sites of deportation in the transatlantic slave trade. The trips immediately attracted hundreds of people, Johnson said, and her travels to West Africa became more frequent. On one trip, she found herself physically compelled — her “body was on fire” — to visit northern Ghana. On her second day in the region, she was asked to pay a customary visit to the Dakpema and his elders in Tamale. She quickly realized that this was no ordinary meeting. “They started consulting amongst each other,” she said, “and then they said ‘we want you to go to prepare to be the Queen.’” Initially, Johnson did not understand the significance of the offer. But when she recounted the meeting to a village elder, he nearly crashed his car. Four months later, with her daughter and best friend alongside her, Johnson was “enskinned” in Tamale — officially recognized as FriendshipQueen — before being introduced to the community in a parade at the annual Damba festival, in which she rode on a horse to cheers from the crowd. “It was overwhelming because the crowd was so big,” said Kendall Jones, Johnson’s best friend who was by her side at the event. “It was my first time ever experiencing having people chase your car down as you’re driving away.” The role of Friendship Queen comes with an elevated status and practical responsibilities to the community. Johnson works together with elders of the Dagbon Kingdom, which dates back to the14th centuryand comprises around five million people, to run positive initiatives in Tamale, where she now lives. So far, together with her charitable foundation Kith and Kin, she has worked to provide clean water, sanitary products, and shoes to the community, and is working on a scheme to support orphans. Locally, she is revered. “You are put on a pedestal,” she said, “There are all the formalities — the bowing, the ‘Her Royal Majesty,’ making sure that you’re taken care of.” It’s a difficult adjustment for someone unfamiliar with celebrity. But to Johnson, the role comes naturally. “She represents peace, unity, hope and the connection of our past to the future,” said the Dakpema, who was instantly impressed by Johnson upon her first visit to his palace. “She is very popular within Dagbon and highly respected. The people admire her.” Kennedy Johnson is not the first Zosimli Naa to be enskinned by the Dakpema. Dr Susan Herlin, an academic from Kentucky, had her title conferred in 1995 and died in 2014. Seven years later, Johnson became the next person to receive the title from the Dakpema Palace. “We felt she was the right choice based on her qualities and her connection to both the Dagbon Kingdom and the diaspora,” said the Dakpema. “By having a Queen who embodies both our rich cultural heritage and strong ties to the world, we open the door to cultural exchange, investment and global awareness.” In November 2024, Johnson was granted full Ghanaian citizenship. In the same month, she was also included in the Most Influential People of African Descent (MIPAD) class of 2024 top 100 futurists and innovators. “It just unfolded to something beyond my dreams,” she said. Johnson is especially popular with the young people of Tamale, who call her “The Swagger Queen,” due to her striking fashion sense that makes full use of colorful Ghanaian fabrics. But no one admires her more than her own daughter, now 28. “It’s the story of a person with everything against them being blessed with everything from the universe,” D’Kiya said. “You can say you’ve seen everything when you’ve seen your mom grow up with a lack of family, and then grow to gain millions of people as her family.” As daughter of the Zosimli Naa, D’Kiya is now considered a princess. “I remember growing up and thinking, maybe one day I’ll play a Disney princess,” recalled D’Kiya, known by her rapper name Stunna Dior. “It’s still a hard thing to conceptualize.” And what would the teenage Kennedy Johnson in Detroit think of the current Queen in Tamale? “I think she would feel inspired,” Johnson said. “If the young version met the current me, she would know to keep going and to keep pushing.”\n",

            "As the end of the year fast approaches, we thought you might enjoy a photo recap of the royal highs and lows of 2024. It was a challenging year for the royal family, with some serious health revelations from King Charles and Catherine, Princess of Wales. But there were also more positive moments as the months ticked on. There were visits to Nigeria and Colombia by Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex and increased visibility for several members of the clan, such as Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh. As questionsswirledover how much the public is entitled to know about the royal family, the relative transparency from the monarch and his daughter-in-law put a spotlight on the cancer struggles faced by so many. The King became patron of Cancer Research UK,visiting cancer patientsas he resumed his public-facing duties at the end of April. Kate’s annual Christmas carol concert highlighted the themes of love and empathy in the “darkest times.” Summer provided some much-needed levity when Taylor Swift chose to goInstagram-officialwith Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce in a selfie with Prince William during her Eras tour. Meanwhile, Kate’s surprise appearance at theWimbledonmen’s singlestennis final had the center court crowd on their feet. Here’s our look at 2024 in images: January:Just a few weeks into the year, it was revealed that both Charles and Kate were dealing with health conditions requiringtime in hospital. Palace statements didn’t reveal the exact diagnoses for either of the royals, which created considerable speculation, but it was confirmed that both would be out of action for a number of months. February:William – dealing with his father’s cancer revelation and his wife’s recuperation from an unspecified abdominal surgery – was called on topick upsome of the King’s responsibilities. He found himself thrust into an increased role. Queen Camilla and Princess Anne also took on more engagements. March:Across the pond, Prince Harry and Meghanvisited Uvalde, Texas, to spend time with the family of a teacher killed in the May 2022 school shooting there. The couple have kept in touch with the family since the massacre. Within days of the tragedy, Meghan traveled to Uvalde to pay her respects after two teachers and 19 children were killed by a gunman. April:In April, Charles looked cheerful as hereturned to public dutieswith his first engagement since revealing his cancer diagnosis back in early February. The monarch took the opportunity to visit a cancer treatment center in London, run by UK charity Macmillan Cancer Support, of which he has been patron for nearly three decades. May:Charles’ first official portrait since his coronation – which depicts the monarch against a fiery red background –proved divisive, with some saying it reminded them of a hellish landscape. Not long after the painting was unveiled, it was vandalized in the London art gallery where it was on display, by activists seeking to draw attention to animal cruelty in farms across the UK. June:William celebrated his 42nd birthday in style atTaylor Swift’s Eras tourat London’s Wembley Stadium. He was spotted dancing in the crowd and even posed for a photo backstage with the singer, accompanied by two of his children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte. “Happy Bday M8!” Swift later posted on her official X account. July:Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh attended Royal Week in Scotland, which celebrates Scottish culture. Like many royals, Sophie has stepped up over the past year to support the British monarch as he has been undergoing cancer treatment. It was a year of firsts for the duchess, who became thefirst member of the British royal familyto visit Ukraine since Russia’s invasion, to show her solidarity with survivors of conflict-related sexual violence. Later in the year, she headed to Africa, visiting Tanzania and Chad, which is in the grip of a refugee crisis amid war in neighboring Sudan. August:The Duke and Duchess of Sussex took their third international trip of the year,heading to the Colombian capital of Bogotá, following earlier appearances in Canada andNigeria. It might have looked like a typical royal visit, but as the couple are no longer working royals, the four-day South American trip was done in a private capacity. They used the event to raise awareness about online harms ahead of the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence Against Children. September:Kate made public hercancer-free statusand her plans to return gradually to public engagements. The announcement was accompanied by a joyful video showing Kate, William and their three children – Prince Louis, Princess Charlotte and Prince George – walking through the English countryside, as well as playing among sand dunes and wading in the sea. October:Charles took part in his first long-haul multi-country trip since his cancer diagnosis, to Australia and Samoa. The visit was full of the usual pageantry but not without drama when a lawmakerinterrupted his speechat Australia’s Parliament House, declaring “You are not my King.” Charles later revealed that he regretted not visiting other countries in the region, like New Zealand and Fiji, but was following doctor’s advice, according to the PA Media news agency. November:William visited South Africa to engage in a back-to-back schedule of eco-related engagements, culminating in the 2024 Earthshot Awards. The glitzy ceremony was attended by the likes of American actor Billy Porter and Australian conservationist Robert Irwin, the son of the late “Crocodile Hunter” Steve Irwin. Environmental issues were the defining theme of the four-day visit to the country – a cause that has been championed by three generations of royals, including William’s grandfather, Prince Philip, and his father, King Charles III. December:Kate looked radiant as she hosted her annual Christmas carol service last Friday at Westminster Abbey. It was the fourth iteration of her “Together at Christmas” concert, which this year was themed around love and empathy. The princess arrived early to make sure she had plenty of time chatting with guests and musical performers. She then headed back outside to greet her family as they arrived.Read more on this story here. King Charles was in jovial form on a visit to London’s redeveloped Battersea Power Station on Thursday, and that was even before he met multi-award-winning British singer Raye, who joined the King on stage, to the delight of the crowd. The Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter’s performance of Christmas songs showcased a voice that won her six Brit awards this year, but she was still starstruck to meet Charles, admitting to everyone gathered that this is “very scary, very fancy, very amazing.” Earlier, the King met small-business owners at a Christmas market set up by King’s Trust alumna Megan Jones, who foundedCurated Makers, an initiative that connects small businesses with retail spaces, after she took part in the King’s Trust’s enterprise program. Charles was then welcomed to Apple’s new UK head office by CEO Tim Cook and hundreds of employees. The monarch met young people recently supported by a partnership between Apple and the King’s Trust. As some shared the new skills and technology they had mastered, the King told them they were “going to go from strength to strength.”\n",

            "In the months before Iranian ballistic missiles struck the Nevatim Airbase in October, Iran dispatched spies to film and photograph the site in southern Israel, according to Israeli authorities. The alleged operatives were neither highly trained nor seemed especially suspicious to the people who knew them in their day-to-day lives. Many of them appeared to struggle financially. And yet, Israeli authorities allege that the images they captured of the base provided Iran with valuable targeting intelligence. The Israel Police arrested the suspects in October, a group of seven Israelis living in Haifa, northern Israel, representing one alleged cell. They are among more than 30 Israelis arrested by Israeli authorities over the past year for allegedly carrying out missions for Iran – with the accusations ranging from photographing military bases to plotting to kill senior Israeli officials. It is an unprecedented number, according to Israel Police Superintendent Maor Goren, who oversees counterintelligence investigations. “If we go check the last years – the last decades – we can count on two hands how many people got arrested for this,” Goren said. It is a sign both that Iran has ramped up its intelligence-gathering efforts in Israel in recent years, and that – after operating for months or, in some cases, years without being detected – Israeli authorities are finally catching on to these under-the-radar activities. Israeli authorities are still uncovering more alleged Iranian intelligence-gathering efforts. Earlier this week, Israeli police arrested a 33-year-old Israeli citizen from the north who allegedly carried out tasks on behalf of Iran in exchange for thousands of dollars. The arrests have made waves in Israel in recent months. Beyond the sheer numbers, the majority of those arrested have been Jewish Israelis – a shock in a country where Jewish citizens are imbued with a deep sense of patriotism and national pride. “I wasn’t surprised – I was shocked. It was like thunder amid clear skies,” said Leonid Gorbachovsky, the next-door neighbor of the accused ringleader of the Haifa cell, Azis Nisanov. “He didn’t have anything prominent in him, nothing that would make me or anyone from our house suspect that he would be connected to something illegal. He was an ordinary man.” Gorbachovsky was home when police pried open Nisanov’s door with a metal bar and watched as police turned the apartment inside-out, finding piles of cash, he said. Like most of the other Israelis arrested on charges of spying for Iran, Nisanov had immigrated to Israel. Combined with financial struggles, intelligence experts say that an immigrant background could make the accused easier targets for Iran’s recruitment efforts. To Gorbachovsky, who moved to Israel 25 years ago from Belarus, it is unfathomable. “How can a person come to a foreign country – to Israel – from a different state and hate it?” Gorbachovsky said. “Well, if it was because of money, then this is a rotten person. How can you sell your motherland for money, even if this is big money? This is your state. How can it be?” Israeli police allege that Nisanov, an Azerbaijani immigrant, began carrying out tasks for Iran more than two years before his arrest, after being contacted by an Azerbaijani national who was working as a foreign agent for Iran. According to the indictment, the foreign agent tasked Nisanov with photographing military bases. For two years, Nisanov and six others he recruited photographed dozens of military bases, Iron Dome batteries and other strategic sites across Israel, receiving between $500 and $1,200 per task, according to the indictment. The indictment notes that several of the bases they photographed were later struck in missile attacks by Iran and its proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah. While the GPS coordinates of the bases are known to Iran, Israeli authorities say the zoomed-in images Iran received from these Israelis provided additional targeting intelligence. “We can’t tell for sure if they are directly responsible for the hit, but we can say for sure that they were there before the attack… so you can say it at least helped, if not more,” Goren said. Israeli police claim Nisanov and the six others knew they were working for Iran. All seven are still awaiting trial on spying charges. They have not yet entered a plea. Nisanov’s attorney Maher Talhami did not deny that Nisanov photographed Israeli military bases, but told CNN that Nisanov “didn’t know that he was dealing with the Iranians.” “He needed a lot of money. He owed money to a loan shark, and he had really bad financial problems,” Talhami said. “He never thought that he was doing something that is harming the security of the state of Israel.” Others arrested by the Israeli police included a couple in the city of Lod in November for allegedly “conducting intelligence gathering missions” on behalf of an Iranian spying network. A police statement, quoting a senior official in the Shin Bet, Israel’s domestic intelligence agency, said that these cases “add to a series of thwarted attempts exposed in recent weeks, during which Israeli citizens operated by Iranian intelligence elements were arrested.” CNN has reached out to the Iranian government for comment on Israel’s allegations but has yet to receive a response. While many of the alleged Iranian spies were only tasked with photographing and filming strategic sites, others are accused of plotting to kill senior Israeli officials and other prominent Israelis. In August, Israeli police arrested 73-year-old Moti Maman, an Israeli from the southern city of Ashkelon, for allegedly plotting to assassinate Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, then-Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Shin Bet head Ronen Bar. Maman was smuggled into Iran twice and met with Iranian intelligence agents who asked him to carry out attacks against Israel, according to his indictment. Authorities allege he received payments to carry out missions on behalf of Iran. The indictment detailed Maman’s travel history as a businessman who lived for extended periods in Turkey, where he allegedly developed relations with Iranian nationals. It alleged that Maman agreed, through Turkish middlemen, to meet with a wealthy Iranian businessman known as “Eddy” to discuss business in the Turkish city of Samandag. On two separate occasions in April and May, the businessman was unable to leave Iran due to “legal difficulties,” so Maman was then smuggled into the country through a land crossing in eastern Turkey. In Iran, Maman allegedly requested an advance payment of $1 million, the indictment said. According to the indictment, “Eddy” allegedly said the plots would be revenge against the assassination of Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh on Iranian soil in July, which would prevent the outbreak of all-out war with Israel. His attorney, Eyal Beserglick, told CNN that Maman traveled to Iran for business purposes only and nothing nefarious. In another case, Goren, the police superintendent, said police arrested a man who was suspected of plotting to carry out an assassination on Iran’s behalf with a gun and 15 bullets. Iran and Israel have been waging a shadow espionage war for decades, using spies and informants to gather intelligence to carry out attacks against each other. Israel’s intelligence capabilities inside Iran are understood to be vast and Israeli intelligence has carried out multiple successful assassinations inside Iran. Following the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel, that silent war was thrust out in the open, resulting in the first open military attacks carried out between the two countries. Iran has also arrested several of its citizens over the last year, whom the regime and the Revolutionary Guard Corps accuse of spying for Israel or collaborating with its foreign intelligence agency Mossad, according to Iranian state media. Israeli officials and intelligence experts say the uptick in Iranian spying activity that has been exposed in Israel reflects broad-based recruitment tactics employed by Iran. Oded Ailam, the former head of counterterrorism for the Mossad, calls it “the theory of the big numbers.” “They are not really discouraged by failure,” Ailam said. “And most important, they don’t really care what happens afterwards to their assets… they say to themselves, ‘OK, if we fail, here we go to the next one.’ And they don’t really care about the outcome.” According to Goren, the police official, Israel’s Shin Bet was primarily responsible for uncovering and infiltrating the alleged Iranian spy rings, through a combination of digital surveillance and undercover operations. Israeli authorities say while some of the accused spies were recruited through intermediaries, others were approached on social media platforms, including Telegram. In a series of Telegram messages provided to CNN by Shin Bet, an alleged Iranian operative sends spam-style offers for “interesting and exciting jobs” that pay “a very high salary.” One message read: “I have various missions in the cities of Israel that not everyone has the ability to do. My missions have rewards from $100 to $100,000.” Another said: “We just need brave men. Are you brave? For a lot of money?” CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the messages. Goren said the Iranian recruiters often began by asking their targets to carry out small “test missions” for easy money, steadily increasing the seriousness of the missions and further compromising their targets. Goren said such a test mission could involve taking a picture of a building or spraying graffiti on a wall. In one series of messages provided by the Shin Bet, the target was tasked with buying gasoline to set off forest fires. “They want fast money,” Goren said of the accused spies. “They don’t care about the country, they don’t care about their own people, they just want money.” Ailam, the former Mossad official, said those who fall into the wide net cast by Iran are often “desperate people from the part of society that is usually neglected and overlooked.” Many of those arrested are also immigrants, who Ailam said may not have “the same affiliation and the same attitude towards Israel” as others. “They are much more easy prey,” Ailam said. Vyacheslav “Slava” Gushchin, alleged to be part of the “Haifa Seven,” appeared to fit this profile to a T. His neighbors said he had immigrated to Israel from Belarus in recent years, had severe financial problems and was frequently drunk. The dentist who worked next door said he was missing most of his teeth and had sought his help for infections. CNN found dozens of discarded cans and bottles of beer in the small patio in front of the apartment he rented. When he was arrested, neighbors at first thought it stemmed from a fight he had gotten into with an attendant at the nearby convenience store. None of them suspected he was allegedly spying for Iran. Gushchin’s attorney declined to comment. “He looked like a miserable low-life,” his neighbor, Riki Yazdi, told CNN, sitting alongside her husband Moshe. His arrest sent shockwaves through a neighborhood that had sought to help him, giving him food, clothes and even lending him money. “No one could believe it,” Moshe Yazdi said. “People here that know him – that also brought him food and everything – want to kill him. If he came here again, the neighbors would kill him.”\n",

            "We are firmly in the home stretch of the 2024NFLseason and there is everything to play for. Several division titles are still to be decided and home-field advantage in the playoffs is on the line, with multiple squads flying high at the top of each conference. Thepostseason picturegets slightly clearer each week, though with a handful of teams still in the hunt, fans will have to wait and see how the seeding shakes out. And of course, theMVP raceis still very much on, though one quarterback may have one hand on the trophy after another stellar display. Here’s a look at the biggest storylines from Sunday’s Week 15 action. In a battle between two of the NFL’s best teams, Buffalo quarterback Josh Allen put on yet another masterful performance to lift the Bills to a 48-42 victory on Sunday to snap the Detroit Lions’ franchise-record 11-game win streak. Allen completed 23-of-34 passes for a season-high 362 yards and two touchdowns and rushing for 105 and two more TDs as he further cemented his MVP candidacy. “Tough win. We figured it was going to be like that here. It’s a really good football team, well-coached team we have a lot of respect for,” Bills head coach Doug McDermott said after the game. The dual-threat quarterback has been on an incredible hot streak as of late for the Bills, scoring 16 total touchdowns – eight through the air, seven on the ground and one reception – while tallying 1,114 passing yards, 223 rushing yards over the past four games, all while having one turnover. “It’s the best I’ve seen him play and (I’m) not surprised. When he sets a goal for himself, for the team, he’s hard to stop,” McDermott added. “People have tried, they’ll keep trying, that’s what we do in this league. I mean just incredible performance week after week. “What more can you say? Every week we’re watching an incredible player, play incredibly consistent week after week.” In the last four games, the Bills have also dealt the two-time defending Super Bowl champions Kansas City Chiefs their only loss of the season. Sunday’s victory came against a Lions team that was the favorite for lifting the Super Bowl entering the game and was on an 11-game win streak with the best record in the NFC. The victory didn’t come easy for the Bills, as they faced off against a Lions team led by quarterback Jared Goff. The Lions signal-caller outplayed his counterpart, throwing 38-of-59 for 494 yards and a career-high five touchdowns in the losing effort. After jumping out to a 21-14 lead in the first half, the Bills began to pull away in the third quarter as James Cook broke out for a 41-yard rushing score, and Allen connected with Khalil Shakir on a short three-yard touchdown to take a 35-14 advantage. However, Detroit responded by scoring two touchdowns to cut the deficit to 38-28.Although the Lions matched the Bills score-for-score from that point on, they never truly appeared as a threat to knock off Buffalo. The Bills’ victory moves them to 11-3, second in the AFC behind the Chiefs, who eased past the struggling Cleveland Browns 21-7. Despite having only lost one game this season, Kansas City has looked much more vulnerable than in recent years. The Chiefs have escaped with a win in several close games anduncanny luck has appeared to bail them out on multiple occasions. While it wasn’t exactly an offensive masterclass seen in previous seasons, Kansas City picked up the comfortable win that it had been craving, taking the victory by more than one score for only the third time this season and improving to 13-1. Though the manner of the win was much needed, Chiefs fans are far more likely to spend time sweating the health of superstar quarterback Patrick Mahomes after the two-time MVP left the game with ankle injury in the fourth quarter. Kansas City attempted to go for it on 4th-and-3 just under seven minutes into the quarter, when Mahomes was wrapped up by Browns defenders on the play. His pass went incomplete and he limped off the field, being replaced by Carson Wentz for the team’s next offensive possession. Mahomes is currently being consideredweek-to-week with a right ankle injury. “I was trying to make a play happen,”the Chiefs star QB said postgame. “As I threw the ball, I got hit, and I haven’t seen it – it felt like someone hit me from behind as well, so kind of got rolled up on. Kind of happens in football. Try to bound back up, but obviously, it hurt a little bit. Now, we’ll get after the rehab part of it and try to be ready for next week. “It’s hard to say right now,” he added when asked about the status of his ankle. “Obviously, still adrenaline rolling. Usually, the day after is when you get a good sense of it. I feel like I could have finished the game in different circumstances.” Mahomes completed 19 of his 38 pass attempts for159 yards and two touchdowns. Kansas City also leaned on the run game, with five different players combining to total 132 yards on the ground. It was also a complete performance from the Chiefs defense, which punished a mistake-prone Browns unit, racking up six sacks and forcing two fumbles. The defense also picked off Cleveland QB Jameis Winston three times, before he was replaced later in the game by Dorian Thompson-Robinson, who also threw his own interception on his second drive. The Browns have failed to look competitive all year and now sit at 3-11 in what has been a season to forget. It appears that, once again, it’s sunny in Philadelphia. The Eagles came out victorious in front of a raucous Philly crowd at Lincoln Financial Field in a cross-state battle against the Pittsburgh Steelers that could have huge ramifications in the battle for home-field advantage in the playoffs. Philadelphia quarterback Jalen Hurts was excellent in the 27-13 victory, throwing 25-of-32 for 290 yards and two touchdowns. It marks an incredible turnaround from Week 14, where the Eagles struggled on offense in a surprisingly hard-fought 22-16 win over the Carolina Panthers. Hurts only threw for 108 yards in that game and wide receiverAJ Brown criticized the passing offenseafter the matchup. Defensive end Brandon Graham also toldSportsRadio 94WIPthat the pair “were friends, but things have changed.” Graham later walked back his comments, but Hurts and Brown seemed to determined to prove his original remarks wrong on Sunday. Brown was targeted 11 times during the game and made eight catches for 110 yards and a touchdown. The receiver was asked after the matchup if his comments about the pass game made a difference to the unit’s performance. “Absolutely,”he said. “I said it for a reason. I didn’t have ill intentions behind it. It wasn’t for me to get the ball. It was for us to all get on the same page and put the best foot forward. It wasn’t our standard. We spoke about it. It’s just crazy though because everybody in the locker room is saying the same thing. I kind of got crucified for it. But it’s cool.” The Eagles took a 17-13 lead into halftime and the defense stepped up after the break, shutting out the Pittsburgh offense in the next two quarters. A Jake Elliot field goal tacked three points on to the lead before a “Brotherly Shove“ touchdown extended it further. Philadelphia moved to 12-2 with the win, tied with the Lions for the best record in the NFC. The 11-2 Minnesota Vikings have the opportunity to make it a three-way battle for the No. 1 seed if they defeat the Chicago Bears on Monday night. It was a tough loss for the 10-4 Steelers, who have been led by a resurgentRussell Wilsonunder center and head coach Mike Tomlin’s standout defense. The Steelers face difficult matchups against the Chiefs, Baltimore Ravens and Cincinnati Bengals to close out the regular season, though their fans can breathe a sigh of relief. Due to defeats for the Indianapolis Colts and Miami Dolphins, Pittsburgh wrapped up a postseason spot on Sunday.

            "Canadian Prime MinisterJustin Trudeaufaces the biggest test of his political career after Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, long one of his most powerful and loyal ministers, announced Monday that she was resigning from the Cabinet. It was a move that stunned the country and raised questions about how much longer the unpopular Trudeau can stay in his job. Freeland, who was also deputy prime minister, said that Trudeau had told her Friday that he no longer wanted her to serve as finance minister and that he offered her another role in the Cabinet. But she said in her resignation letter to the prime minister that the only “honest and viable path” was to leave the Cabinet. “For the past number of weeks, you and I have found ourselves at odds about the best path forward for Canada,” Freeland said. Freeland and Trudeau disagreed about a two-month sales tax holiday and $250 Canadian ($175) checks to Canadians that were recently announced. Freeland said that Canada is dealing with US President-elect Donald Trump’s threat to impose sweeping25% tariffsand should eschew “costly political gimmicks” it can “ill afford.” “Our country is facing a grave challenge,” Freeland said in the letter. “That means keeping our fiscal powder dry today, so we have the reserves we may need for a coming tariff war.” The resignation comes as Freeland, who chaired a Cabinet committee on US relations, was set to deliver the fall economic statement and likely announce border security measures designed to help Canada avoid Trump’s tariffs. The US president-elect has threatened to impose a 25% tax on all products entering the US from Canada and Mexico unless they stem the numbers of migrants and drugs. Trudeau has said that he plans on leading the Liberal Party into the next election, but there are some party members who don’t want him to run for a fourth term. It wasn’t immediately clear what Freeland’s resignation from the Cabinet means for Trudeau’s immediate future. “This news has hit me really hard,” a shocked Transport Minister Anita Anand said. She added that she needed to digest it before commenting further. Opposition Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre said that the government is losing control at the worst possible time. “Justin Trudeau has lost control, but he’s hanging onto power,” Poilievre said. “All this chaos, all this division, all this weakness is happening as our largest neighbor and closet ally is imposing 25% tariffs under a recently elected Trump with a strong mandate, a man who knows how to identify weakness.” No Canadian prime minister in more than a century has won four straight terms. The federal election has to be held before October. The Liberals must rely on the support of at least one major party in Parliament, because they don’t hold an outright majority themselves. If the opposition New Democratic Party, or NDP, pulls support, an election can be held at any time. Trudeau channeled the star power of his father in 2015, when he reasserted the country’s liberal identity after almost a decade of Conservative Party rule. But the son of late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau is now in big trouble. Canadians have been frustrated by the rising cost of living and other issues like immigration increases following the country’s emergence from the COVID-19 pandemic. “As a country we have to project strength,” Ontario Premier Doug Ford said. “It’s chaos right now up in Ottawa.” Trudeau’s legacy includes opening the doors wide to immigration. He also legalized cannabis and brought in a carbon tax intended to fight climate change. Freeland said in the resignation letter that Canadians “know when we are working for them, and they equally know when we are focused on ourselves. Inevitably, our time in government will come to an end.” Freeland’s resignation comes as Trudeau has been trying to recruitMark Carneyto join his government. Carney is the former head of the Bank of England and Bank of Canada. He was so well regarded after helping Canada dodge the worst of the global economic crisis that the UK named him the first foreigner to serve as governor of the Bank of England since it was founded in 1694. Carney has long been interested in entering politics and becoming the leader of the Liberal Party. It wasn’t immediately clear if Carney has agreed to join Trudeau’s Cabinet. “This is quite a bombshell,” said Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto. “Freeland was not only finance minister but also deputy prime minister and, until a couple of years ago, was seen as Trudeau’s heir as Liberal leader and prime minister.” Wiseman said that leaks from the prime minister’s office suggest that she was a poor communicator and made Freeland’s status questionable. “There was talk about her becoming foreign minister again and that would have been a good fit for her, but the stab in the back from the prime minister’s office cast the die,” Wiseman said. Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, also called it a political earthquake and not just because Freeland was the second most powerful official in government. “Also because of how she resigned: by publishing a letter on social media that clearly criticizes the prime minister only hours before she was supposed to present the government’s fall economic statement,” Béland said. “This is clearly a minority government on life support but, until now, the (opposition) NDP has rejected calls to pull the plug on it. It’s hard to know whether this resignation will force the NDP to rethink its strategy.” NDP leader Jagmeet Singh released a statement, but didn’t say whether his party would vote to topple the government. “While the Liberals fight with each other, I believe we should be fighting for Canadians jobs at risk from Donald Trump’s tariffs,” Singh said in a statement. “People deserve a government that fights for you for a change.”\n",

            "An 11-year-old girl has been found clinging to tire tubes off the Italian coast after the migrant boat she was on sank three days earlier. The girl is from Sierra Leone and has been named as “Yasmine” in Italian media. She was found with a life jacket in the Mediterranean Sea early Wednesday morning by the crew of Trotamar II rescue vessel, which is run by the German NGO Compass Collective. She told rescuers that the boat had left Sfax in Tunisia over the weekend with around 45 people on board, including her young brother, according to a statement from the rescue charity German NGO Compass Collective. A storm in the area at the time had halted operations for several NGO rescue vessels around the Italian island of Lampedusa. The girl said two others had initially survived when the metal boat overturned in the storm, but they disappeared into the water hours before she was rescued. All other migrants are presumed dead. Trotamar III skipper Matthias Wiedenlübbert said they heard her cries in the darkness around 3:20 a.m. Wednesday (9:20 p.m. ET Tuesday). The boat, which had been on its way to another rescue, started patrolling the area after spotting debris from the capsized vessel. “It was an incredible coincidence that we heard the child’s voice even though the engine was running,” he said. “And of course we looked for other survivors. But after the day-long storm with over 23 knots and 2.5-meter-high waves, it was hopeless.” The girl was rushed to Lampedusa where she is being treated for hypothermia. She is expected to survive, according to the Red Cross, which manages the migrant center on the island. The same night, the NGO distributed lifejackets to another boat in distress with 53 people on board before alerting Italian authorities of its location. It is not clear if those people were rescued. Crew member Katja Tempel said: “Even during storms, people are forced to use risky escape routes across the Mediterranean. We need safe passage for refugees and an open Europe that welcomes people and gives them easy access to the asylum system. Drowning in the Mediterranean is not an option.” More than 64,000 people have been rescued in the Central Mediterranean trying to reach Italy between January 1 and December 11, according to government statistics. Of those, 7,879 have been unaccompanied minors. The miraculous rescue has reignited the debate about providing safe corridors for those seeking asylum in Europe. Earlier this year, Italyattempted to openmigrant processing centers in Albania, but their legality has been caught up in the Italian court system.\n",

            "TheMiami Dolphinssay wide receiver Grant DuBose “has movement in all extremities” after he was carted off the field Sunday following a hit to the head during the team’s 20-12 road loss to theHouston Texans. “After sustaining a head injury in yesterday’s game, Grant DuBose remained at a local Houston hospital for evaluation overnight,” the Dolphinswrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. “He has movement in all extremities and initial tests have revealed positive results. He remains under the care of doctors for continued observation.” DuBose was taken to the hospital after the incident and the Dolphins said he is in a “stable condition.” The Miami wideout was cutting across the middle of the field in the third quarter and attempted to catch a pass from Dolphins quarterbackTua Tagovailoawhen DuBose took a helmet-to-helmet hit from Texans rookie safety Calen Bullock. Bullock was flagged for unnecessary roughness on the play. DuBose was down on the field for more than 10 minutes as medical personnel had to cut off his jersey, unscrewed his facemask and place a neck brace on him before he was carted off NRG Stadium in Houston. Players from both teams gathered together – some were seen praying – as DuBose received on-field care. The CBS broadcast said DuBose was still receiving care from the Harris County emergency medical staff while being loaded into an ambulance. Tagovailoa said after the game that DuBose is “doing well” and is “recovering.” The quarterback also wondered if he could have done anything differently with his pass to DuBose. “I’m my toughest critic when it comes to ball placement – when it comes to knowing where to go with the ball,” Tagovailoa said after the Dolphins loss. “I just feel bad that I even put him in that situation to have gotten hit. “It was tough to move on after that happened. … We all know I’ve gone through something very similar and that’s no fun. You never want to be put in any of those situations, but you also understand that this is a physical sport.” DuBose is now at Memorial Hermann hospital in Houston, according to CBS. After the game, Dolphins’ head coach Mike McDaniel gave a status update on the injured wide receiver. “There’s been some positive feedback related to some head and neck imaging,” McDaniel said. “He will stay here overnight, and we’ll find out more by (Monday.)” Bullock said afterward that he had no intention of hurting DuBose or anyone else. “Prayers to him and his family. I hope he is good,” he said. “I was just seeing the ball and I was breaking on the ball. It just happened to be one of those types of plays,” he said. “It’s very difficult for a defensive player because we are trying to think about protecting them, but we also got to protect ourselves too,” Bullock said. “They can hit us wrong. It’s angles. You thinking too much trying to protect everyone on the field, but sometimes it doesn’t happen like that. At the end of the day, it’s still a violent game.” CNN has reached out to the Dolphins for comment. The Dolphins just activated the 23-year-old DuBose for Sunday’s game after being on the injured list with a shoulder injury. This story has been updated with additional information.\n",

            "Notre Dame, the treasured Gothic gem in Paris that went up in flames in 2019, will officially reopen Saturday. Immediately after the fire, French President Emmanuel Macron made the ambitious pledge to restore the church within five years. On Friday, he praised hundreds of artisans, carpenters and other specialists for helping him “keep this promise” during his final site visit. “You did it. And it’s an immense source of pride for the entire nation. I’m infinitely grateful to you, France is infinitely grateful to you,” Macron said. Here’s everything you need to know about the days ahead. On April 15, 2019, Notre Dame was engulfed in flames. The cause of the blaze remains a mystery. Investigators say it was likely an accident – perhaps a burning cigarette or an electrical malfunction. France – and much of the world – despaired as the 860-year-old cathedral’s roof caved in, strewing the stone floor below with soot. Macron called it a “terrible tragedy,” and pledged to rebuild the landmark church “because it is what our history deserves.” Some of the country’s richest businessmen pledged hundreds of millions of euros towards the restoration. After more than 2,000 days’ work – involving 2,000 people, 2,000 oak trees and 2,000 features restored or rebuilt – the world got its first glimpse of “Our Lady of Paris” last week, as the French president toured the restored landmark with his wife, Brigitte, and a cluster of clergymen. The official reopening begins with a ceremony on Saturday, followed by eight days of special masses and prayers. The guest list will be long and illustrious, but the most notable attendee will be Donald Trump. The US president-electannounced this weekhe will travel to Paris – his first overseas trip since last month’s election – for what will be “a very special day for all.” The ceremony is expected to draw some 50 heads of state and government. One noteworthy absentee, however, will be Pope Francis. The pontiff will travel to the French Mediterranean island of Corsica on December 15, just days after the reopening, but is skipping a visit to the capital. A leading French archbishop said the “star” of the ceremony ought to be Notre Dame itself, and that the pope did not want to distract from the occasion. Some 170 bishops from France and around the world will also be involved in the ceremony, along with one priest from each of the 106 parishes in the Paris diocese. Macron will give a speech in front of the cathedral at around 6 p.m. (12 p.m. ET). The Archbishop of Paris Laurent Ulrich will then strike the closed cathedral doors with his crozier, an ornate staff. Once the doors open, the cathedral “responds” to the knock by singing Psalm 121 – which begins “I will lift mine eyes unto the hills” – three times. After this, the doors will open. The ceremony then proceeds in three parts. First, the “awakening” of the great organ – the largest in France, comprising 8,000 pipes and 115 stops. Second, the “chanting of the office” – a series of psalms and prayers, including the Lord’s Prayer. Then, the archbishop will give a final blessing and the choir will sing Te Deum, a Latin hymn. The service will be followed by a broadcast by France TV, chronicling the cathedral’s rebuilding. The inaugural mass will be held Sunday morning at around 10.30 a.m. (4.30 a.m. ET), with Macron in attendance. After blessing the holy water, the archbishop will sprinkle it over the congregation and then the altar. The biblical readings given at mass will be the same the world over, marking the second Sunday of Advent. A second mass will be held on Sunday evening, which will be open to the public. For the eight days after the reopening, masses will be held twice daily, along with special evening ceremonies. Many of these services will be open to the public. On December 17 and 18, the cathedral will host concerts of Johann Sebastian Bach’s “Magnificat.” The cathedral expects to welcome up to 15 million visitors each year. For now, visiting remains free. Guests will be able to book a free ticket online and access the building either on the same day or one or two days after booking.\n",

            "An alleged Chinese spy who forged a close relationship with Prince Andrew has been identified by a British court, the latest twist in a case that has shone a light on Beijing’s influence inside Britain’s institutions. The man, Yang Tengbo, was identified after a judge ruled his anonymity should be removed, PA Media reported on Monday. Yang, who also went by the name Chris Yang, was described in a separate court hearing last week as developing an “unusual degree of trust” with the younger brother of King Charles. He was the co-founder of Pitch@Palace China, which expanded into China an initiative for entrepreneurs that was set up by Andrew in 2014. In a tribunal hearing on Thursday that upheld an earlier decision to bar Yang from the UK, it was revealed that he was authorized to act on Andrew’s behalf during business meetings with potential Chinese investors in the UK, and that he was invited to Andrew’s 60th birthday party in 2020. Yang has appeared in pictures and videos with Andrew during Pitch@Palace events. Yang said in a statement he had “done nothing wrong or unlawful,” and that the “widespread description of me as a ‘spy’ is entirely untrue,” PA Media said. Andrew’s office said last week that the prince ceased his relationship with Yang after receiving government advice. “The Duke met the individual through official channels with nothing of a sensitive nature ever discussed,” his office said. “He is unable to comment further on matters relating to national security.” The case has once again led to questions about the judgement and associations of Andrew, whose role in the royal family has diminished since his friendship with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein came to light five years ago. But concern over China’s influence in Britain’s politics and institutions has been steadily mounting in Westminster in recent years, and the case is just the latest example of an alleged infiltration by Beijing. Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committeereleased a reportin 2023 outlining its view that China was seeking to target and influence people in the UK’s political system. Yang is alleged to have worked for China’s United Front Work Department (UFWD), a branch of the ruling Communist Party tasked with gaining influence both at home and overseas. The report described the UFWD – as working to “ensure that politicians and high-profile figures in foreign states are supportive of the CCP, or at the very least do not criticise China or counter its narrative.” A statementpublished onlineby a spokesperson from the Chinese Embassy said that the situation underscored “anti-China clamours made by a handful of UK MPs” who had “done nothing but fully revealed their twisted mentality towards China.” “What they are really up to is to smear China, target against the Chinese community in the UK and undermine normal personnel exchanges between China and the UK. We strongly condemn this,” the statement said. Yang joins a growing number of people who have been accused of spying on behalf of China from inside the heart of Britain’s institutions. Two men, one of them a parliamentary researcher, are awaiting trial afterbeing chargedwith breaching the Official Secrets Act on behalf of China, which they deny. And in 2022 the MI5 spy agencywarned lawmakersthat Christine Lee, a woman connected to the Chinese Communist Party, had been working to interfere in the UK political process. Former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith, who raised the incident in an urgent question in the House of Commons on Monday, told the BBC the case was “the tip of the iceberg.” “The reality is that there are many, many more involved in exactly this kind of espionage that’s taking place,” he said. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer told reporters on Monday: “Of course we are concerned about the challenge that China poses.” But the Yang case led to renewed scrutiny on Monday over his stance on Beijing. Starmer in November became the first prime minister to meet with China’s President Xi Jinping for six years, and reiterated Monday: “Our approach is one of engagement, of co-operating where we need to co-operate, particularly on issues like climate change, to challenge where we must and where we should, particularly on issues like human rights and to compete when it comes to trade.” During the Monday parliamentary debate, the government was also accused of being slow to implement a new foreign influence registration scheme (FIRS) scheme, first planned by the previous Conservative government, which is aimed at increasing transparency and reducing the risk of overseas interference in Britain. It was initially set to be implemented this year, but has been delayed until the middle of 2025. A Labour MP, who is part of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China that Duncan Smith set up, told CNN the response within Parliament to the Yang case was “shock, but not surprise.” “You can’t fudge the geopolitics of China, and all the implications for trade and industrial strategy and defense for very long,” the MP added, in a nod to criticism over Starmer’s approach. “I don’t think it’s possible to have your cake and eat it in this world.” Shawn Deng contributed reporting.\n",

            "Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is expected to undergo an additional medical procedure on Thursday as part of his treatment following the emergency surgery he had Tuesday to drain a bleed on his brain. Medics from Sao Paulo’s Sírio-Libanês Hospital will perform an endovascular procedure on Thursday morning as part of his “therapy program,” according to a note released by the hospital Wednesday afternoon obtained byCNN  Brasil. The president’s doctor, Roberto Kalil, told Reuters the procedure was considered a “complement” to Tuesday’s surgery. “This involves a catheterization that targets the meninges artery. Why? Because when a hematoma is drained, there is a slight chance that the small arteries in the meninges could cause a minor bleed in the future,” Kalil said. In previous comments soon after the surgery, Kalil had said it was “important to note that (Lula) did not sustain any brain injury. The hematoma, the bleeding, was not inside the brain; it was outside the brain and has been completely drained.” Lula – who remains in the hospital’s intensive care unit – spent the “day well, without complications, underwent physiotherapy, walked and received visits from family,” the note released by the hospital says, adding that “the president remains under the accompaniment of the medical team.” The 79-year-old Lula wasoperatedon Monday due to a brain bleed linked to a fall in October. The emergency surgery added to health concerns about the aging president, a standard-bearer of the Latin American left who is halfway through his third non-consecutive term. Lula has curtailed travel in recent months while doctors monitored his recovery from trauma to the back of his head, sustained when he fell at his home in late October, requiring stitches. Prior to the emergency surgery, Lula had complained of a worsening headache during a congressional event Monday evening in the capital, Brasilia, and was taken to a local hospital for examination, presidential spokesperson Paulo Pimenta said in a radio interview. An MRI scan detected an intracranial hemorrhage, and Lula was flown to Sao Paulo soon after for the surgery, according to a medical note released by the government.\n",

            "Pope Francisurged Catholic priests on Sunday to guard against spiritual groups that stoke political divisions, speaking during a one-day visit to Corsica, the first by a pontiff to the French Mediterranean island. At a conference on religion across the Mediterranean, the pontiff warned against varieties of spirituality that “seek self-aggrandizement by fueling polemics, narrow-mindedness, divisions and exclusivist attitudes.” “The Church’s pastors (are) called to be vigilant, to exercise discernment and to be constantly attentive to (these) popular forms of religiosity,” the pope said. Francis, making his third and probably last foreign trip of 2024, did not name any specific religious groups. Corsica, like much of France, has a long history of lay Catholic associations, known as confraternities. They usually focus on spiritual matters but sometimes play a role in local politics. The pope will spend about nine hours in Ajaccio, Corsica’s capital, on Sunday. After attending the conference, he will celebrate an outdoor Mass with local Catholics and will also meetFrench President Emmanuel Macron. Visiting places that often do not draw international attention is part of Francis’ policy of highlighting people and problems in what he calls the “peripheries” of the world. Over his 11-year papacy he has still not visited most of the capitals of Western Europe, including Paris. Macron had invited Francis to attend the December 7 reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral, five years after a devastating fire nearly destroyed the medieval building. The pope decided not to go, and the two will instead meet briefly at Ajaccio’s airport on Sunday before Francis heads back to Rome. As is now normal, Francis, who turns 88 on Tuesday, left his plane on arrival in Corsica via an elevator and used a wheelchair while greeting officials on the tarmac. During a brief ride in an open-air popemobile from the airport, the pope waved at crowds on the street and appeared on good form, though he still has a small bruise on his chin, the result of what the Vatican described as a minor fall in his bedroom last week. Corsica, famed for its steep, mountainous terrain and as the birthplace of Napoleon Bonaparte, is the fourth largest island in the Mediterranean. It is one of France’s poorest regions, where about 20% of the population lives below the poverty line, according to government figures. The Vatican estimates that about 81% of Corsica’s population of 356,000 is Catholic. There are 83 priests on the island and some 30 Catholic nuns, it says. Francis, originally from Argentina and the first pope from the Americas, has traveled widely around the Mediterranean since becoming pontiff in 2013, visiting Malta, the Greek island of Lesbos, and the Italian island of Lampedusa.\n",

            "A Palestinian grandfather in Gaza whosetribute to his slain granddaughterwent viral last year was killed by Israeli fire on Monday, his family and a hospital said. Khaled Nabhan drew global attention in a widely shared social media video of his moment of grief in November 2023, as he kissed his lifeless granddaughter Reem goodbye – the 3-year-old girl he called “the soul of my soul.” “I used to kiss her on her cheeks, on her nose and she would giggle,” he told CNN at the time. “I kissed her but she wouldn’t wake up.” His grandchildren, Reem and 5-year-old Tarek, were killed while they were sleeping in their bed. Their home was brought down by what Nabhan said at the time was a nearby Israeli airstrike in the Al Nuseirat refugee camp in southern Gaza. Speaking to CNN following the strike, Khaled described his final evening with his grandchildren,breaking down in tearsas he recalled how they begged him to take them outside to play. He had refused because of the danger from Israeli airstrikes, he said. On Monday,Khaled was killed by an Israeli tank shell, according to Al-Awda Hospital in Nuseirat, central Gaza. Saed Nabhan, Khaled’s nephew, told CNN on Monday that there was tank shelling in their neighborhood. As he ran towards Al-Awda Hospital, he was shocked to find his uncle among those killed. Saed said eyewitnesses told him that his uncle “saw injured people and ran to help, but he was instantly killed by another tank shell.” He added:“What a great man we have lost. We will never have someone like him again.” In footage shared on social media by local journalists in Gaza, Nabhan’s lifeless body is seen lying on a hospital bed, covered in blood, as weeping crowds huddle around him. “Oh, Abu Diaa,” people are heard crying, referring to Nabhan by his nickname.

            "In the early years of Xi Jinping’s war on corruption, the Chinese leader consolidated control over the world’s largest military by taking down powerful generals from rival factions and replacing them with allies and proteges loyal to himself. A decade on, having given the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) a structural overhaul and stacked its top ranks with his own men, the supreme leader is still knee-deep in his seemingly endless struggle against graft and disloyalty. And, like many strongman leaders in history, he is increasingly turning against his own handpicked loyalists. Late last month, Xi purged one of his closest proteges in the military – a decades-old associate entrusted with instilling political loyalty in the PLA and vetting senior promotions. Adm. Miao Hua, who sits on the Central Military Commission (CMC), the top command body chaired by Xi, has beensuspended under investigationfor “serious violations of discipline,” the Defense Ministry announced, using a common euphemism for corruption and disloyalty. As the head of the CMC’s political work department, which oversees political indoctrination and personnel appointments, Miao is the most senior scalp in Xi’s latest military purge. Since last summer, more than a dozen high-ranking figures in China’s defense establishment have been ousted, including the last two defense ministers promoted to the CMC by Xi. But none of them boast the kind of long-standing relationship Miao shared with the top leader, dating back decades to Xi’s early political career in the coastal province of Fujian. The probe into Miao opens a new front in a widening purge that hasraised questionsover Xi’s ability to end systematic corruption in the military and enhance its combat readiness at a time of heightened geopolitical tensions. Over the past decade, Xi has overseen an ambitious transformation of the PLA into a “world class” fighting force that can rival the US military. A key goal of that modernization drive is to ensure China is ready to fight and win a war over Taiwan, the self-governing democratic island Beijing claims as its own. But Miao’s downfall renews questions – raised during last summer’s purges – about how much confidence Xi has in his top generals who would be responsible for leading a war, said Joel Wuthnow, a senior research fellow at the Pentagon-funded National Defense University. “If he fears that he has brought in people who are not unquestionably loyal to him or his agenda, that would be a huge problem.” Experts say Xi’s purge of a longtime acolyte points to a familiar dilemma for autocrats, including his predecessor Mao Zedong: after eliminating political rivals, the supreme leader never stops looking for new threats to their absolute hold on power – including from their own close circle. Miao’s history with Xi goes back three decades. The Fujian native served as a political officer in the former 31st Group Army from the 1980s to the early 2000s, when Xi was rising through the ranks as a local official to become the provincial governor of Fujian. “According to credible sources, Xi regularly visited the 31st Group Army at the time” and is known to have had personal contacts with Miao, said James Char, a longtime PLA-watcher and assistant professor at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. Miao’s military career took off soon after Xi came to power. In 2014, he received a major promotion to become the political commissar of the PLA Navy, making an unusual switch from a career in the Ground Force. Three years later, he was promoted again into the CMC, the apex of military power. “We cannot find a more apodictic acolyte of Xi than Miao,” Char said. “If Miao is eventually indicted of graft, clearly Xi himself had not anticipated the obscene extent of corruption that exists among PLA elites.” For the past 18 months, Xi’s cleanup had largely targeted officials connected to the procurement of weapons and the Rocket Force, which oversees China’s nuclear and conventional missiles. But Miao’s downfall signals a broadening of that crackdown into new sectors, such as political work – which Xi has described as the “lifeline” of the military – and the Navy. “Wherever they look, I’m sure they will find issues and cases. It’s just a matter of which sector they pick,” Char said. The Defense Ministry has offered no details about the allegations against Miao. As the chief political commissar of the PLA, Miao is tasked with ensuring its loyalty to the ruling Communist Party. He oversees promotions in the military, vetting key candidates for their political loyalty – a role he also held in the Navy. In the past, such roles have offered fertile ground for graft, especially bribes for promotions. Miao’s predecessor, Gen. Zhang Yang,killed himselfwhile under disciplinary investigation for bribery. As the geopolitical rivalry between the United States and China heats up, the PLA Navy has also seen a drastic increase in the procurement of warships and other weapons, providing ample opportunities for corruption, said Victor Shih, a political science professor at the University of San Diego. But there could be another potential reason behind Miao’s downfall, Shih said, for “being too obvious in his attempt to foster a faction in the military.” Xi has repeatedly warned against the forming of factions in both the party and the military. “Of course, the only person who is allowed to do that is Xi himself,” Shih added. Miao is seen by some analysts as having recommended multiple associates in the Navy for promotions to key positions, including Rocket Force Commander Wang Houbin and Defense Minister Dong Jun. The announcement of Miao’s investigation came a day after the Financial Times reported that Dong had been placed under investigation for corruption, citing current and former US officials. The Defense Ministry dismissed the report as “sheer fabrication,” and days later, Dong made a public appearance at a security forum. Wuthnow, the expert at the National Defense University, said what led to Miao’s downfall was a “loss of confidence,” but the reasons for that remain elusive. In one scenario, Wuthnow said, Xi might have viewed Miao as becoming too powerful and independent, and wanted to uproot what he saw as a bastion of influence that he could not fully control. “I don’t think this is how leaders who are confident in their own power and ability to corral the bureaucracy behaves. It actually strikes me as a sign of weakness, if not paranoia, that he feels he needs to constantly overturn the apple cart,” he said. Miao’s downfall comes less than a year after former defense minister Li Shangfu was removed from the CMC. The powerful body had six members – all deemed as Xi’s loyalists – serving under the top leader when he began his unprecedented third term two years ago. If Miao is also removed, it would leave two vacant seats. Shih, the expert on Chinese elite politics, said many dictators, from former Soviet leader Joseph Stalin to Mao, have eventually turned against their own proteges. “Once all of their real competitors are gone, a dictator can never think to themselves: ‘Oh well, all the threats are gone. I can just relax.’ Because they always think that new threats could emerge, including from people who once were very close to them. This happens over and over again,” he said. As a result, the dictator is always looking for increasingly subtle signs that someone is plotting against them, said Shih, the author of “Coalitions of the Weak,” which examines Mao’s hold on power in the late stage of his life. During Mao’s last years, he turned against Lin Biao, his longtime protege, former defense minister and heir apparent, accusing him of plotting a coup. “This kind of dynamic will become increasingly severe as Xi Jinping gets older, as his health is not as robust as previously. His sensitivity to signs of potential challenge to his power will also become keener over time,” Shih said. For now, the top leader appears determined to carry on his crusade against corruption and disloyalty. Earlier this month, Xi inspected the PLA’s Information Support Force with his four remaining loyalists on the CMC. “We must ensure the troops remain absolutely loyal, absolutely pure and absolutely reliable,” Xi told an audience of note-taking officers.\n",

            "Syria’s new regime, led by a group with former ties to al Qaeda, is on a mission to gain international legitimacy – and it’s already seeing some success. Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, an internationally sanctioned former jihadist, has been meeting foreign dignitaries since his group Hayat Tahrir al Sham (HTS) ousted ex-President Bashar al Assad’s regime last week. He seeks to present Syria’s new regime as a friendly, inclusive and non-belligerent state. On Sunday, he secured a meeting in Damascus with Geir Otto Pedersen, the UN special envoy for Syria, who said the international community will “hopefully see a quick end to sanctions, so that we can see really a rallying around building up Syria again.” The envoy however warned that there must be “justice and accountability for crimes,” but that they must go through “a credible justice system.” And on Monday, EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said she “tasked a European top diplomat in Syria to go to Damascus to make the contacts with the new government and people there,” adding that EU would consider more steps “if we see that Syria goes in the right direction.” So far, the United States and the United Kingdom have also established contact with the rebel groups ruling the country, along with Qatar and Turkey. UN officials have met with Syria’s interim prime minister, and the UK this week sent a delegation to Damascus, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said at a press conference on Monday. Experts say that while Syria’s unfolding events present an opportunity to prevent the state from collapsing, they also come with uncertainties and risks as the country’s new leaders come to power – many with an unsavory past. Jolani, who now goes by his real name Ahmad al-Sharaa, and his group, HTS, burst out of their pocket of territory in the northwest of Syria earlier this month, swiftly taking control of the country’s second-largest city Aleppo before capturing the strategic city of Hama and then the capital Damascus. Despite his efforts over the years to distance HTS from al Qaeda, the US designated the group a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 2018 and placed a $10 million bounty on him. HTS and its leader are also designated as terrorists by the UN and other governments. Qutaiba Idlbi, a senior fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Middle East Programs who focuses on Syria, said that while engaging with the US- and UN-designated terrorist organization “will present its challenges, the designation presents important leverage for the United States and international partners.” The incoming Trump administration could “use that leverage to ensure HTS walks the walk as an acceptable actor within the Syrian scene and affirm it is no longer threatening US or regional security,”Idlbi wrote for the Atlantic Council,adding that this can be done through dialogue with Turkey, which had long been at odds with Assad. On Saturday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington has had direct contact with HTS, in the first public confirmation of direct contact between the US and the group. “Yes, we’ve been in contact with HTS and the other parties,”Blinken saidat a news conference in Jordan, adding that the contact was direct. He  gave no details on when the contact was made or at what level. There is no legal barrier to speaking with a designated terrorist group. Inhis first sit-down media interviewwith CNN at an undisclosed location in Syria, Jolani pushed back against the enduring terror designation, calling the label “primarily political and, at the same time, inaccurate.” The rebel leader has argued that some extreme Islamist practices had “created a divide” between HTS and jihadist groups early on, and claimed to oppose some of the more brutal tactics used by other jihadi groups which led to his severing ties with them. He also claimed that he was never personally involved in attacks on civilians. It is unclear whether Western states will lift the terror designation or what will become of the pre-existing sanctions that were placed on the former regime. Asked whether the terror designation hinders the US’ ability to speak to the rebel group, and whether the designation will be lifted, a senior state department officialtold reporterslast week that the US is watching whether HTS’s statements “are translated into actions on the ground.” “We’re very much hopeful they will be,” the official said. Syria’s economy has been cripped for years by Western sanctions. Among the harshest is the US’ 2019 Caesar Act, which imposed wide-ranging sanctions that restricted individuals, companies or governments from economic activities assisting Assad’s war effort. The act rendered the entire economy untouchable. According to the World Bank, the county’s economy shrank bymore than halfbetween 2010 and 2020. As of 2022,poverty was affecting 69%of Syria’s population, according to the World Bank. Extreme poverty affected more than one in four Syrians in 2022, the World Bank said, adding that this number likely deteriorated after a devastating earthquake in February 2023. Idlbi, of the Atlantic Council, wrote that while Assad’s fall presents an opportunity, it is “not a panacea and could lead to further instability if not carefully managed.” “The Biden and Trump administrations must adopt a balanced and strategic approach, focusing on inclusive governance, humanitarian support, and regional stability,” Idlbi wrote. “An opportunity of the kind that now presents itself in Syria comes only once.”\n",

            "Accurately predicting the weather is hard — really hard, but a new AI-powered forecast model just hit a milestone that has experts saying your forecast could soon get more accurate, and further out, too. It takes a Herculean effort to keep pace with weather in an atmosphere constantly in flux. The task is so difficult and complex that a reliable forecast more than a couple of days in advance was unheard of just a few decades ago. A five-day forecast in the early 1980s was only accurate about 65%of the time. But better weather observations, more robust computing power and innovations in the way weather around the globe is modeled by computers has improved forecasts by leaps and bounds. Today the same forecast hits the marknine times out of 10. Forecasts took another step forward this month, experts said, thanks to GenCast, a new artificial intelligence forecast model by Google’s DeepMind. Its forecasts through 15 dayswere significantly more accurate than one of the most well-respected traditional non-AI forecast models, according to a study published by DeepMind in the journalNature. “It’s an impressive result,” said Peter Dueben, a machine learning expert and head of Earth system modeling at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, home to the model bested by GenCast. “It’s a big step.” GenCast isn’t ready for the public yet. It and other AI models still have a few key kinks to work out, particularly in forecasting the more frequent and severe weather of a warming world, before they change forecasting and save lives in the process. The skill and usefulness of weather forecast models has always been closely tied to technology. The majority of weather forecast models used today are based on a complex series of mathematical equations that model the physics of the atmosphere and use hundreds of millions of datapoints from real-time weather observations to paint a picture of how the weather will play out a day, a week or even a season from now. This process of numerical weather prediction was first conceived in the early 1900s and needed to be done by hand, a method so slow that the weather had already happened long before calculations were finished. Early computers improved forecasting in the 1950s and 1960s, but it wasn’t until 1974 that the first model able to pull in data from around the globe and generate a rudimentary forecast became operational. Skip to the current day and supercomputers are performing a nearly unfathomable number of calculations daily to produce highly detailed weather forecasts many days into the future around the globe. But current forecast models still have limitations. The most robust ones can only be run every few hours because of how long it takes to crunch the complex calculations. They also demand a lot of computing power and energy that make them costly. And they have limitations when it comes to forecasting, too. The farther out in time they get from observations of the atmosphere, the more difficult it is to get a clear idea of what’s to come because the atmosphere never stops changing. Most AI weather forecasting models like Google’s GenCast take a different approach. Rather than relying onobservations plugged intophysics-based equations, they predict how Earth’s atmosphere might behave in the future by analyzing verified past weather data to understand how the atmosphere behaved in similar situations.This helps improve accuracy over traditional models by eliminating errors from real-time weather data. AI forecast models also run simulations a lot faster and use less computing power and energy than traditional models once they’re trained and ready to go. This means they can be run more frequently and model a wider range of possibilities, improving forecasts as they do. AI weather modeling before Google’s GenCast has been limited to models that spit out a singular forecast without any indication of how likely it is to happen. It’s essentially a best guess that’s most useful for predicting common weather variables like temperature, precipitation and wind a handful of days in advance. But GenCast runs dozens of simulations simultaneously. “Once you have multiple possible futures it gives you a sense of both the range of what might happen and it also lets you calculate how likely some (futures) are rather than others,” according to Ilan Price, the lead author of the new study and a senior research scientist with DeepMind. This type of modeling approach is highly regarded because it lends more confidence to weather forecasts for around five to 15 days in the future. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts’s model is widely considered to be the gold standard. It was what Google wanted to beat with its first-of-its-kind AI version — and it did. Researchers trained GenCast on 40 years of weather data up to 2018. They then used the trained model to predict more than 1,300 combinations of conditions like temperatures, precipitation and wind speeds, in 2019’s weather. The AI model produced more accurate forecasts than the ECMWF’s traditional model for more than 97% of these variables within a 15-day timeframe, but showed particular skill within the first week of forecasts. It showed anywhere from a 10 to 30% accuracy improvement on forecasts in the three-to-five-day range, depending on the exact combination of variables tested, according to Price. GenCast also had more accurate forecasts than the ECMWF’s model up to 15 days in the future, the study said. The AI model could better capture some forms of extreme weather, including exceptionally high and low temperatures and extreme wind speeds. GenCast also needed less than 10 minutes to run on a supercomputer, compared to the hours necessary for traditional models. The results mark an “inflection point” in AI weather modeling technology, Price said. “AI-based weather forecasting is ready for prime time,” Price added. “It’s ready to start being incorporated alongside… traditional models in operation.” GenCast is not in operation yet, but the DeepMind team plans to take another step toward it by releasing its present-day forecasts and an archive of its past forecasts, according to Price. GenCast is a critical advancement in modeling, but like any other weather forecast model, it isn’t perfect. AI models introduce a new potential issue since they predict the future based on what they’ve seen in past data. “The machine learning model… doesn’t know anything about physics,” Dueben explained. This can make it difficult for AI to conceive of future extremes that haven’t occurred in the recent past. Can an AI model trained on only 40 years of data accurately predict the types of extremes happening at arecord pacein a changing climate, like a once-in-100 year or once-in-1,000 year torrential rainfall event? “It turns out that actually these models are more robust to those extreme events than you would think,” Dueben said. The ECMWF has tested AI models against real-time weather for more than a year now and has seen improvements in their overall accuracy, even with extreme events, he explained. But AI models can start inventing impossible-on-Earth physics the farther out in time they look, according to Dueben. Other prediction issues remain, particularly with one of the most destructive weather phenomena: tropical cyclones. Accurately predicting how strong a tropical cyclone like a hurricane or typhoon could become is an issue that plagues all models. It’s a crucial problem to solve astropical systems get strongerandrapidly intensify more frequentlyin a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution. GenCast showed better skill than traditional models when predicting the tracks of tropical systems but struggled to accurately capture intensity, according to Price. In part, that’s because some of the recent notablerecord-breaking systemsweren’t included in the 40 years of data GenCast was trained on, Price noted. It’s an issue Price is “quite confident” can be overcome in the future as the model trains on more data. There are also models in development combining machine learning with real-world physics — known as hybrid models — that could be the solution to some of these problems. Each step forward with this nascent technology adds another tool human weather forecasters can use to craft accurate forecasts people rely on for almost every aspect of their lives. “You can be as skeptical as you want against machine learning forecasts in principle,” Dueben said. “These models will make a positive impact on our weather predictions; there’s no question there.”\n",

            "France’s embattled PresidentEmmanuel Macronhas appointed centrist ally Francois Bayrou as prime minister, he announced on Friday, as he seeks to calm a political crisis that has left his authority dwindling by the day. Macron’s office made the announcement a week after the former office holder Michel Barnier lost avote of no confidence, forcing him to submit his resignation. Bayrou ran for president three times before rallying behind Macron in 2017. The 73-year-old is the founder of the centrist Democratic Movement political party (MoDem), and mayor of the southwestern town of Pau. He must now form a government and look to pass a budget through a sharply divided parliament, where Macron faces an avowed opposition from both the left-wing and far-right blocs. “Everyone is aware of the difficulty of the task,” Bayrou told reporters in Paris on Friday. “I think that there is a path to be found that brings people together instead of dividing them.” Barnier’s minority government collapsed after just three months as it attempted to pass a 2025 budget, which included €60 billion ($62.9 billion) worth of tax hikes. His effort to force the agenda through without a vote gave lawmakers the chance to oust him, and left- and right-wing forces united to bring Barnier down. Bayrou will take on that challenge, but it is unclear whether his stint in office will prove more fruitful than his predecessor. He must pass his own budget before December 21. If that deadline is missed, the government could still legislate a “fiscal continuity law,” which would avoid a shutdown by allowing the government to collect taxes and pay salaries, with spending capped at 2024 levels, according to the S&P Global Ratings credit rating agency. Jordan Bardella, the president of the far-right National Rally (RN) party, told CNN affiliate BFMTV on Friday that “there will not be an automatic censure motion” against Bayrou. “Our red lines are the same (on the budget),” he added. “The ball is in François Bayrou’s court.” Marine Le Pen, the RN figurehead who has challenged Macron in his two successful presidential runs, added her group is “asking (Bayrou) to do what his predecessor was unwilling to do: listen to the opposition to build a reasonable, well-considered budget.” “Any other policy that would simply be an extension of Macronism, twice rejected at the ballot box, could only lead to deadlock and failure,” she said. Barnier’s proposed financing bill, which sparked his downfall, aimed at bringing the country’s budget deficit down to 5% next year, according to government calculations. Some of the measures are hugely unpopular with opposition parties, such as delaying matching pension increases to inflation. France’s ongoing political crisis was unleashed when Macron called snap parliamentary elections for July, a poll which resulted in a divided parliament that left the president’s centrist lawmakers sandwiched by powerful blocs on the left and the far-right. Last week Macron defied calls to step down, saying in a televised address that parliament should “do what it was elected for” and act “in the service of the French people.”\n",

            "At Umayyad Square in central Damascus, tens of thousands of people had the party of a lifetime on Friday. Filling the roundabout to the brink, they partied late into the evening, celebrating the moment many thought would never come:the exit of their brutal dictator Bashar al-Assad. “I always thought that I am going to die, and my children are going to die, and many more generations will die and he will still be here. I thought it will never end,” Esraa Alsliman, a student, told CNN at the square. “It’s like a dream. I wake up every day thinking it was a dream, even today I woke up thinking it was a dream,” she said. Families brought little children to the square with flags painted on their cheeks. Young students were joined by the elderly. Women dressed in conservative Muslim fashion celebrated next to those wearing trendy western clothes. Many said they travelled across the country to witness the jubilations. Many were waving the three-starred flag of the Syrian Arab Republic – an opposition flag that had been used when the country was under French mandate, and was replaced by a two-starred version during the Assad era. “I really believe that at this time, we will support each other, stay with each other and get to the top. Syria will have a good name in the world,” Alsliman said. “I always thought that to have a future, to have a successful life, I will have to go abroad. Now I can stay here, in my country.” For half a century, the Assad family had ruled over Syria with an iron fist, with long-documented reports of mass incarceration, torture, extra-judicial killings and atrocities against their own people. On Sunday, after 13 years of civil war that fractured the country, the regime came crashing down. Rebel fighters declared Damacus “liberated” in a video statement on state television, sending Syrian PresidentBashar al-Assadfleeing to Russia. Friday’s huge crowds started gathering at the square after midday prayers at the historical Umayyad Mosque in Damascus, just days after the rebel leader Abu Mohammad al-Jolani declared a “victory for the entire Islamic nation” there. The congregational prayers – seen as the pinnacle of the Islamic week – were the first since the fall of the Assadregime. The sermon at the mosque was delivered by Syria’s new caretaker Prime Minister, Mohamed Al-Bashir, who called the moment “the birth of a nation.” But despite overwhelming joy, there also signs of the country’s current fragility. The rebel coalition that has taken over Syria is made up of many groups with varying ideologies and goals – and nobody seems to know for sure what will happen next. Dozens of armed men wearing military-style fatigues joined in the celebrations, some letting excited little boys pose with their Kalashnikovs, the children flashing bright smiles and victory signs into the cameras. Every now and then, celebratory gunfire rang through the air. At one point in the afternoon, some in the crowd grew angry, appearing to chase an individual down. “They found a military guy!” someone in the crowd shouted out. But soon the crowd was back to dancing, clapping and chanting. “The donkey is gone! Donkey! Donkey!” the crowd chanted at one point, with many still in disbelief that the deposed president’s pejorative nickname can be shouted out loud in the open, rather than whispered in secrecy. Fatima Baghdadi told CNN she had come to the square to see the moment for herself. The 80-year-old has lived most of her adult life under the regime. One of her sons was killed in the war and her grandson lost a leg in an attack. “I was 30 when the big donkey came into power. For 50 years, we were squeezed, and I was praying all the time, asking God to get rid of him. And now he had. We can breathe again,” she said, her eyes moist with tears.

            "At least 127 people, mostly civilians, were killed in Sudan on Monday and Tuesday by barrel bombs and shelling from the warring sides, rights activists said. The 20-month-old war between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has been turning increasingly bloody as ceasefire efforts have stalled, and crises elsewhere have dominated world attention. The army has stepped up airstrikes in the half of the country that the RSF controls, while the RSF has stagedraidson villages and intenseartillery strikes. Both have targeted densely populatedcivilian areas. More than eight barrel bombs hit the market in the North Darfur town of Kabkabiya on Monday, the pro-democracy Al-Fashir Resistance Committee said. Emergency Lawyers, a human rights group, said more than 100 had been killed and hundreds wounded. The army has frequently targeted towns in North Darfur with airstrikes as it fights the RSF for control of the state capital, al-Fashir, its last foothold in the region. It denied responsibility for the attack on Kabkabiya, while insisting that it had the right to target any location used by the RSF for military purposes. The RSF did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An image shared by Emergency Lawyers showed shrouded bodies in a mass grave. Video verified by Reuters showed bloodied bodies strewn around the market. It also showed fires burning and people being carried from the wreckage of stores and fruit stalls. People can be heard crying and screaming in the footage, while others pray for those who were killed. One man is heard saying: “People are dying wholesale.” The video also shows armed men in the headwraps typically worn by RSF soldiers on motorcycles. An activist from Kabkabiya said that, while there were typically a few soldiers in the market and other parts of the town, the vast majority of those present were civilians. He said 87 bodies had been identified, but that some were too charred or mutilated to identify. On Tuesday, the RSF aimed heavy artillery fire at an army-controlled sector of Omdurman, part of Khartoum state, residents said. Emergency Lawyers said at least 20 people had been killed, including at least 14 who were riding on a bus that was hit. The state government, controlled by the army, said 65 people had been killed, and that other casualties had been transferred to nearby Al-Naw Hospital. Images circulating on social media not verified by Reuters showed shrouded bodies on the street amid vehicle wreckage. The United Nations has said more than 30 million people need aid, and some 12 million have fled their homes. Famine has been declared in Zamzam camp in North Darfur, where shelling on Tuesday killed seven people, according to Adam Rojal, spokesperson of the Coordinating Committee for Displaced People.\n",

            "A huge and teeming Mediterranean port with a gritty reputation, Marseille isn’t typically seen as one France’s classic destinations, yet the country’s second biggest city by population has recently found itself in the spotlight. First it was couture house Chanel putting Marseille on the fashion map when it brought a major summer show to the city’sRadiant City Art Centre. Then one of its neighborhoods wasvoted the coolest in the world. Suddenly, the oldest city in France was on weekend getaway hit lists. As soon as you visit, it’s easy to see why. It has stunning historical architecture — both dating from the Byzantine period and modernist examples like a post-war residence (now a hotel and museum) designed by architect Le Corbusier. Marseille is an inspiring blend of the cultures brought here by the various immigrant communities who’ve found their way to the city over the centuries. That’s partly the reason why the food scene is wildly good. Marseille’s chefs take the attitude to fresh produce from the surrounding region of Provence, and add the flair of multiculturalism. Ambitious young kitchen creatives are also experimenting and combining the results with the region’s wines, many of the best from vineyards run by women. And it’s France, so good cheese comes as standard. Then there’s the sea, which hugs the city protectively and, on a sunny day, glistens invitingly (and the town’s residents oblige by jumping in). There’s also an edge — which is exactly what attracts the cool crowd. It’s got port city grit. Those 18th-century stone facades are plastered in graffiti, the backdrop noise is the thrum of revving motorbike engines. There are regular protests. There is sometimes violence. And the unmistakable smell of weed follows you around. Despite being a city in Provence, this is not a rural idyll of the kind the region is known for — and it’s riotously more exciting for it. Like visiting any big city for a break, visitors will need to prioritize where to go. Marseille is enormous: dramatically demonstrated when you climb the steep hill up to theNotre-Dame de la Garde basilica, which at 150 meters (492 feet) above sea level, offers an amazing panoramic view of the sprawling city. It’s fascinating to see how over the centuries (the basilica dates back to a smaller church building built in 1214), houses, streets and neighborhoods (Marseille is called the “city of 100 neighborhoods”) have sprung up, pushing all the way out to giant futuristic tower blocks teetering at the edge of distant mountain ranges. Having gained its fame and fortune from maritime trading, Marseille still places great importance on its historic Vieux Port (Old Port). Still the heart of the city, it’s a good place to begin explorations. The beautiful harbor (cleaned up when Marseille became a European Capital of Culture in 2013), has markets, waterside restaurants, late-night bars and plenty of buzz. There’s the majestic Abbaye St-Victor, the oldest church in Marseille. Founded in the fifth century, abandoned during the French Revolution and restored in the 19th century, it’s still attracting pilgrims and tourists today. Then there’s the medieval hospital known as Hôtel-Dieu, built on Roman remains, and now reincarnated as the five-starInterContinental Marseille - Hôtel-Dieu. Positioned just up the hill from the harbor, with a well-lit façade (classed as an historic monument in 1963), it can be glimpsed from several vantage points around the port. For a trendy new coffee spot,Chez Moeoffers coffee and cardamon buns by day and organic wines by night on Grand’Rue, at the bottom of the Dieu’s steps. North of the port are the charming, winding streets of Le Panier, filled with cafes and independent boutiques selling crafts (peer through the shuttered windows and you might see them being made). With colorful buildings and cobbled streets, it has the feel of a provincial town rather than a bustling city. Craving a dip in the sea? It’s an easy walk back around the quay to the city beach under the Citadelle de Marseille, also known as Fort Saint-Nicolas. On a sunny day you’ll be pressed to find a square inch of empty sand, but the inviting water more than makes up for it. Further along the coast is another beach, Plage des Catalans. And a walk along the delightful La Corniche Kennedy waterside path leads to Piscine maritime Vallon des Auffes: a seawater swimming pool sheltered by a small rocky harbor. For waterside sunsets, locals take corner store beers and takeout pizza onto the rocks underLes Bords De Merhotel. Marseille is great for shopping. Down on the luxe Rue Grignan, where the white-stoned buildings are distinctly less graffitied than elsewhere in town, there are the high-end stores like Hermès, Louis Vuitton and Cartier. Slip one street back for more moderately-priced contemporary French fashion stores including the Marseille-foundedSessùnon Rue Saint, along with Sandro and Maje nearby. Bargain-hunters will love Du Côté D’Estelle on Rue Jean-Baptiste-Estelle, which sells beautiful like-new versions of all the above (cash only). For chic homewares, there’sSessùn Alma, on Rue Sainte. The brand’s homeware line, only available in this standalone store, focuses on beautiful, mainly local, crafts. Maison Empereuron Rue des Récolettes is a magical four-floored treasure trove of homewares from Sabre knives to brass jelly molds to vintage linens and an entire room of Marseille soaps. For many, the main draw of Marseille is its exciting food scene. The traditional local dish is bouillabaisse, a Provencal fish soup, but finding a decent rendition among the many waterfront restaurants advertising it is tricky — locals rarely eat it out so it’s generally laid on for tourists. If you can afford it, the three-Michelin starLe Petit Nice Passedatserves some of the best options. The restaurant’s “bouillabaisse menu” costs 390 euros ($412) and must be ordered 48 hours in advance. Not that you need official Michelin stars to eat well in Marseille. Down the wending Rue de Lorette isRipaille: a cute restaurant lit by candlelight with snug tables, extremely friendly staff and a confidently small menu. Unassuming neighborhood jointKennedy Poissonnerieserves up plump oysters, enormous prawns and bulots (sea snails) in its fish platter.La Mercerie, in a former haberdashery near the port, serves beautifully styled plates, reasonably priced for a three-course meal, paired with sommelier Laura Vidal’s wine selection. Even when it’s super-casual, food here is done well. You’d be hard-pressed to find a better and more stuffed sandwich anywhere than atRazzia— there’s barely room to sit in so take your bulging lunch to the nearby Place Jean Jaurès, itself lined with street food options, to eat with locals on lunch breaks. Because isn’t that always the best way to see a new city?\n",
            "https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/16/weather/white-christmas-forecast-climate/index.html\n",
            "Christmas is approaching nearly as fast as Santa’s sleigh, but almost anyone in the United States fantasizing about a movie-worthy white Christmas might need to keep dreaming. Early forecasts indicate temperatures could max out around 10 to 15 degrees above normal for much of the country on Christmas Day. It’s a forecast reminiscent oflast Christmasfor many, which came amid thewarmest winter on recordin the US. But the country could be split in two by warmth and cold in the run up to the big day. Unseasonably warm conditions will dominate the western half of the US — including Alaska and Hawaii — while the eastern half will be quite cold until Christmas, according to the Climate Prediction Center. High temperatures in Washington, DC, for example, could fail to climb above freezing from next Sunday through Tuesday but could rebound into the more-typical 40s for December 25, which also marks this year’s start of Hanukkah. Even though it could be cold in the East, it’s also expected to be much drier than normal from next weekend through the holiday, conditions that should be in place across much of the Lower 48, according to the center. That’s bad news for snow lovers. It’s too soon to pinpoint exactly which areas will be dry or see storms, so some white Christmas dreams could stay alive until the forecast is fully in focus. Some wet weather could impact parts of the East on Christmas Day. Early forecasts show a potentially sloppy mix of rain and snow could impact high elevation areas of the Northeast. Some snowflakes could flutter over a few spots in the Rockies on Christmas. Any of these scenarios are far from guaranteed over a week in advance, and minor shifts in the weather pattern over the next week could change the forecast. At least 1 inch of snow needs to be on the ground on December 25 in order for it to count as a white Christmas. It doesn’t necessarily have to fall the same day. If a few flurries fly through the air but they melt on contact with the ground, sorry, that’s not a white Christmas. But if mounds of snow are still on the ground after multiplemassive lake-effect eventseven though it’s not actively snowing on Christmas — winner! That’s a white Christmas. The mountains of the West, parts of Michigan and New York, along with interior northern New England likely haveenough snow on the groundnow that at least an inch of it will stick around through Christmas Day. The number of locales in the US likely to have a White Christmas is limited, even if completely average temperatures were in store this year. North-central states like the Dakotas, Minnesota and Wisconsin, along with mountainous portions of the West and Northeast are most likely to have a white Christmas any given year. That’s because the north-central US is usually quite cold by late December. The chill helpsprevent snow dumped by quick-moving storms — typical for the region in late-fall or early-winter — from melting. Multiple rounds of snow tend to build a decent snowpack in the mountains of the West and Northeast by late December, but sometimes this blanket of snow is found only in the highest elevations where not many people live. If you want a white Christmas in a city setting, your best bets historically are Minneapolis – about a 70% chance — or Burlington, Vermont — around a 60 to 65% chance. The Chicago area has about a 35 to 40% chance of a white Christmas each year while New York City and Philadelphia’s chances are an abysmal 10 to 15%. Chicago and Minneapolis last had a white Christmas in 2022, but New York City, Philadelphia and Washington, DC, haven’t experienced one since 2009. Atlanta and much of the South have about a 1% chance or lower of seeing a white Christmas. CNN Meteorologists Monica Garrett and Derek Van Dam contributed to this report.\n",

            "The US Department of Transportation has issued a new rule requiring airlines to follow more rigorous standards when it comes to airline passengers with disabilities. The new rule will require airlines to meet standards for “safe and dignified” assistance to people with disabilities, especially those who use wheelchairs. It also mandates annual training, including hands-on training for employees and contractors who physically assist passengers and handle wheelchairs. That training must be received by June 17, 2026. “Every passenger deserves safe, dignified travel when they fly — and we’ve taken unprecedented actions to hold airlines accountable when they do not provide fair treatment to passengers with disabilities,” said Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigiegin a release. The rule will also require promptness when assisting passengers with disabilities with enplaning, deplaning and connections. For example, assistance should be available when the last passenger who did not request assistance has exited the aircraft. A little over 1% of wheelchairs and scooters were mishandled during the month of September,according to the latest Air Travel Consumer Reportfrom the Department of Transportation. The new rule also requires loaner accommodations for wheelchairs or scooters that are mishandled and provides more protection to passengers in the event of loss or damage. Many airlines already offer pre-boarding or other assistance for travelers with disabilities, but manyair travelers have complainedto the DOT about delays, poor treatment and mishandled wheelchairs. The DOT recently slapped American Airlines with a$50 million fineafter a multi-agency investigation uncovered repeat violations of the rules designed to protect airline passengers who use wheelchairs.

            "In an age ruled by neatly slicked buns, it’s easy to forget there was a time before extra-hold gel — when hair was encouraged to expand rather than contract. At the LA premiere for “A Complete Unknown” Tuesday night, Elle Fanning took it upon herself to remind us of those halcyon days, with a bouncy blonde beehive that acted as a portal to the past. Her 1960s-style up-do was finished with a pair of tousled pigtails, secured with two crystal hair-ties which doubled as Fanning’s jewelry for the evening. The actor — who plays Bob Dylan’s girlfriend Sylvie Russo in James Mangold’s upcoming film — arrived onto the red carpet in a custom white Gucci silk gown trimmed with crystal embellishments. Stacked hair has shifted in and out of vogue since the 18th century, when Marie Antoinette popularized “le pouf” — a high mass of hair so heavily decorated and adorned it often required a cushion to keep its shape. In 1960 it was reimagined by Chicago-based stylist Margaret Vinci Heldt, the official mother of the beehive, and quickly became one of the most recognizable hairstyles of the 20th century. The conical pile of locks were inspired by the silhouette of fez and pillbox hats beloved by Jackie Onassis and fixed into place using a mixture of pins and copious hairspray. It was a signature style for Brigitte Bardot, Barbara Streisand, Dolly Parton and, this side of the millennium, by British singer Amy Winehouse. Yet although the retro look has been making a slow and steady return, it’s not to be confused with the hair crowns of yore. Today, height is no longer the primary metric of success for a beehive, as celebrities and brands opt for a more subtle lift. For Versace’s Spring-Summer 2024 runway, models were dressed in swingin’ sixties mini-dresses and given tasteful miniature bouffants. Similarly, at Bora Aksu’s Spring-Summer 2025 shows, models sported twin sets, cats eye sunglasses and towering ‘dos. And while Nicola Coughlan, Zendaya and Kaia Gerber have all embraced the power of hair-teasing this year, the aim for this new style is less Marge Simpson, more muted. While Fanning’s mid-century style is a welcome break from the ballerina buns du jour, it’s still a far cry from the mantra most associated with Dolly Parton: “the higher the hair, the closer to Heaven.”\n",

            "Two Russian cargo ships carrying oil products are in distress following bad weather in the Kerch Strait between mainland Russia and annexed Crimea, the country’s ministry of emergency situations said Sunday. A helicopter rescue team has flown to the site of one of the vessels, “Volgoneft 212,” which was damaged after running aground, prompting crew to request assistance, the ministry said. The ship’s 13-strong crew has been evacuated, the ministry added. One person is known to have died. A second cargo ship, “Volgoneft 239,” went adrift after sustaining damage in the same region, the ministry said. The second vessel has 14 people on board. “The operational headquarters is working. More than 50 specialists and 11 units of equipment are already involved in the response. Further information is being clarified,” the ministry said in a statement. The ministry added that the extent of a possible oil spill is being assessed. A video circulating on unofficial Ukrainian and Russian Telegram channels appears to show a large cargo ship snapped in two, with water spilling over the edge of the top deck of the vessel as choppy waves rock it from side to side. The bow of a ship, which can be seen in the background of the video, has broken off and appears just above the water line. Crew members can be seen wearing lifejackets as the camera spins around. CNN has been unable to independently verify the location of the video. Ukraine has regularly targeted Russian infrastructure in or near Crimea, a territory it is seeking to recapture after it wasillegally annexed by Russia in 2014, but there is no suggestion that the incidents are conflict-related.\n",

            "Buckingham Palaceis investigating after a member of staff was arrested at the end of a rowdyChristmasparty. Police were called to a bar in Victoria in central London – a short walk from the palace – on Tuesday evening when a festive celebration turned violent. A 24-year-old woman, who has not been identified, was arrested on suspicion of common assault, criminal damage and of being drunk and disorderly, London’s Metropolitan Police told CNN. The woman, who subsequently spent Tuesday night and much of the following day in a police cell, is believed to be a maid at the palace and was on a night out with around 50 members of palace staff at the time, according toThe Sunnewspaper. She reportedly smashed some glasses and turned on a member of the bar staff. Management at the royal residence say the matter is now being investigated and that disciplinary action could follow. A palace spokesperson told theBBC: “We are aware of an incident outside the workplace involving a number of Household staff who had previously attended an early evening reception at the Palace. “While this was an informal social gathering, not an official Palace Christmas party, the facts will be fully investigated, with a robust disciplinary process followed in relation to individual staff and appropriate action taken.” The spokesperson told the BBC that the post-reception drinks, which staff went on to at the bar, were informal and had not been arranged by the palace. A palace spokesperson confirmed the statement to CNN. A spokesperson for London’s Metropolitan Police confirmed the incident to CNN in an email, saying: “At 21:21hrs on Tuesday, 10 December officers were called to a bar in Victoria Street, SW1 following reports that a customer had smashed glasses and attempted to assault a member of staff. “Officers attended and arrested a 24-year-old woman on suspicion of common assault, criminal damage and being drunk and disorderly. “She was taken into custody and released the following evening having been given a penalty notice for disorder.”\n",

            "France’s largest musical instrument is ready to sound again. It has taken months of painstaking cleaning and decontaminating of 8,000 pipes, 115 organ stops and numerous other musical components, buton Saturdaythe majestic tones of the Grand Organ ofNotre Damewill ring out once more. It will be the first time the revived instrument has been played in front of an audience since the Parisian landmark went up in flames more than five years ago. Like the Virgin Mary statue that emerged from the blaze miraculously unscathed, the organ somehow managed to avoid significant damage in the April 2019 fire. It was structurally intact, but remnants of the collapsedlead roof filled its cavernous pipes and the cracks between its keys. That thick, yellow powder posed no threat to the instrument’s machinery, but the dust needed to be removed for another reason: it was toxic to humans. So, as with countless other centuries-old relics and architectural elements inside the cathedral, highly specialized craftspeople were required to get the organ back to its pre-fire form, or as close to it as possible. Veteran organ builder Laurent Mesme’s company, Orgues Quoirin, was one of three workshops chosen from across France to restore the Grand Organ. Mesme described the process as “incredible.” “It was an exceptional worksite. Usually, the organ builder starts to work when everything is done,” he said. “Here, we had to work with the masons, the painters and all the other professionals on site.” The restoration process involved more than 30 artisans who spent months dismantling the organ and restoring its electrical and mechanical components before the deep-clean. They were among more than 2,000 craftspeople in total to be involved in the cathedral’s restoration, many using traditional methods from generations ago, according toPresident Emmanuel Macron’s office. Tuning the organ took another six months. “This kind of maintenance, where you dismantle the entire organ, usually happens every 50 or 100 years,” Mesme said. “The next restoration isn’t going to happen any time soon.” To tune an organ, one needs a perfect ear and, typically, complete silence, the latter of which proved nearly impossible to find on the highly specialized construction site. To accommodate this, one team started tuning the pipes by day, while another team perfected the work through the night after construction teams had left. These nocturnal artisans were assisted by the four organists of Notre Dame, each of whom was intimately acquainted with the unique character of the organ’s sound from years spent playing the instrument. “It wasn’t possible any other way,” saidorganist Olivier Latry. “During the day it was impossible to do anything (with the noise).” Latry had, in his words, lived with the organ “day and night” since joining the cathedral in 1985. He said it felt strange to spend so much time away from it after the fire. “It’s really a very intimate bond that’s been established. And it’s funny, the fact that the organ has been out of commission for five years and we find it again, it’s a bit like finding an old friend we haven’t seen for a few years,” he told CNN. Thanks to this collaboration between artisan and musician, the sound of the organ has been restored to exactly as it was before the fire, though it remains to be seen if the acoustics of the cathedral will match once the new furniture is added. Latry and Notre Dame’s three other organists are set to play when the cathedral hosts its reopening ceremony on Saturday. The music for what organizers have dubbed the “grand awakening” of the organ will be improvised by the musician based on the emotion of the historic moment, according to Latry. When they finally play, the artisans who restored the organ will have etched their own unique mark onto a piece of French history. “Every time there has been a restoration, the organ builders have preserved what the previous organ builders have done. As a result, the organ is not the work of a single builder. It’s really a shared work that unfolds over three or four centuries,” Latry said. “It’s a bit like this organ is the history of France,” he added.\n",

            "New Delhi (AP) —Zakir Hussain, one of India’s most accomplished classical musicians who defied genres and introduced tabla to global audiences, died on Sunday. He was 73. The Indian classical music icon died from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a chronic lung disease, at a hospital in San Francisco, his family said in a statement. “His prolific work as a teacher, mentor and educator has left an indelible mark on countless musicians. He hoped to inspire the next generation to go further. He leaves behind an unparalleled legacy as a cultural ambassador and one of the greatest musicians of all time,” the statement read. Hussain was the most recognizable exponent of tabla, a pair of hand drums that is the main percussion instrument in Indian classical music. Considered the greatest tabla player of his generation, Hussain had a career that spanned six decades in which he collaborated with the likes of singer-songwriter George Harrison, jazz saxophonist Charles Lloyd, drummer Mickey Hart and cellist Yo-Yo Ma. The son of legendary tabla artist Ustad Alla Rakha, Hussain was born in 1951 in Mumbai and was taught how to play the instrument by his father at the age of 7. A child prodigy, he began performing alongside India’s classical music legends during his teens. In 1973, Hussain formed the Indian jazz fusion band “Shakti” with jazz guitarist John McLaughlin. The band played acoustic fusion music that combined Indian music with elements of jazz, introducing a new sound to Western audiences. In 2024, Hussain became the first musician from India to win three Grammy awards in the same year. Hussain’s “Shakti” won Best Global Music Album, and his collaboration with Edgar Meyer, Béla Fleck and flutist Rakesh Chaurasia won Best Global Music Performance and Best Contemporary Instrumental Album. He had earlier won a Grammy in 2009. In 2023, Hussain received the Padma Vibhushan, India’s second-highest civilian award. Hussain is survived by his wife and two daughters.\n",

            "Fifty years ago, parishioners from Jim Jones’ Peoples Temple in San Francisco began to settle a rural commune in the South American country of Guyana. The Jonestown experiment ended four years later in one of the most tragic and bizarre murder-suicide incidents in American history. More than 900 people died on November 18, 1978, including a US congressman named Leo Ryan. Now thatGuyana is considering a proposal by a government-backed tour operator to open the now-overgrown compoundto visitors, it raises a fascinating debate about the appeal, ethics and sensitivities of so-called “dark tourism” — the visiting of sites associated with tragedy. Why are the locations of past atrocities, natural disasters, infamous deaths and incarcerations so popular with visitors? What does it say about us that we want to get close to these vortexes of disaster and evil? What obligations do governments have to give or deny access? Who gets to decide how history is presented to visitors? And what impact do such events and the subsequent visitors have on those who live near these spots? There are no simple answers, but it’s important to explore the questions anyway. On my first cross-country trip, in college, my girlfriend and I stopped at the Alamo in San Antonio, Texas, the site of a battle in which nearly 200 died, including a former US congressman named Davy Crockett. Then a week later in Los Angeles, local relatives of mine took us on a driving tour that included the crime scene address of then-recently murdered Nicole Brown Simpson. The former visit felt like a US history lesson, the latter like morbid gawking. And somewhere in between is the subjective line that dark tourism dances around. Dark tourism (also known asmemorial tourism, or thanatourism, from the Greek “Thanatos” meaning death, or more derogatorily as morbid tourism, or grief tourism) comes in various shades. Gettysburg was the single deadliest battle in the US Civil War, where 51,000 souls took their last breath, and yet where countless school field trips and, according to the National Park Service, 1.5 million visitors flock every year. Is that dark tourism? How about visiting the beaches in France where between 8,000 and 14,000 soldiers died in the D-Day invasions that turned the tide for Allies winning World War II? And what of Ground Zero and Flight 93 memorials for more than 3,000 who died on September 11, 2001? I have toured Cambodia’s Killing Fields, with a survivor of the Khmer Rouge genocide that left between 1.5 and 3 million murdered (in the four years following the Jonestown tragedy). Isn’t it important to visit atrocities such as that one,and former Nazi concentration camps? The point of visiting these places is to feel uncomfortable, to bear witness, to share what you’ve seen and how it made you feel. Travel changes us, and sometimes because of exposure to the worst of human nature. You’ve heard of the Disneyfication of places. Dark tourism is the opposite of that. These are the unhappiest places on earth. Yet they are places you should never forget. To go there honors the dead, their memory, their pain. There are examples when the line seems less clear, where bearing witness to past events feels more like slowing down to see the aftermath of a fatal car accident. The first time I visited Savannah, Georgia I took a “Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil” tour. This was not long after the best-selling book of that name became a Hollywood film chronicling a real double murder that took place less than 10 years earlier. On the tour I kept thinking, “The people who live next door to these places may actually remember the victims, may have even been friends with them.” Just last month we reported on how the Los Angeles mansion where Lyle and Erik Menendez murdered their parents has becomethe latest “dark tourism” hot spot. The brothers are back in the news and the subject of a recent documentary, but it’s hard to imagine what visitors are learning by simply staring at a crime scene. It reminded me of my Simpson murder scene visit, or the time I tried to find LA’s Cielo Drive, the site of the 1969 murders by the Manson “family.” But how many degrees are those stops from touring Ford’s Theatre in Washington DC where a president was shot, or the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza in Dallas from which another was? Is it ok to see thousands of Mount Vesuvius’ victims in Pompei, Italy because they were killed 2,000 years ago? How about going on an entertaining tour of Jack the Ripper’s victims in London from the late 1800s? Or paying a lot of money to go deep underwater for a view of the Titanic – where visitors themselves died last year while exploring a shipwreck where about 1,500 died just over 100 years ago? Does time desensitize us to these crimes and tragedies? In the early 2000s, while visiting friends living in Gloucester, Massachusetts, I felt an undertow pulling me toward the Crow’s Nest, the local bar made famous in a book by Sebastian Junger and the subsequent film of the same name, “The Perfect Storm.” They document the 1991 storm and final days of six fishermen from the small, tight knit community who frequented the Crow’s Nest. On one visit I was walking along Gloucester’s small harbor when I saw a new ice cream shop had opened called The Perfect Scoop. I thought it rather distasteful, a description I’ve never before nor since used to describe ice cream, and it left me feeling embarrassed for having wanted to visit the Crow’s Nest. I decided to leave the salty bar to the locals. But I’ve enjoyed the murder-heavy night tour of San Francisco’s Alcatraz prison island; walked through the “Bloody Sunday” neighborhood of Derry, Northern Ireland; visited Anne Frank’s home in Amsterdam and was equally moved by The National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis, Tennessee, inside the old Lorraine Motel where Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. This summer I’m planning a family trip to Japan and added Hiroshima to the itinerary because I feel it’s important for my daughters to make a connection to the violence our country unleashed on another country, killing at least 66,000 in that city alone. And I’ve long wanted to visit Jonestown. When I lived in San Francisco, just before seeing a show at the famous Fillmore auditorium, I popped around the corner to see the location of Jim Jones’ Peoples Temple, the last stop before Guyana. I feel drawn to follow that nightmare of a story into the real world, where it has been sitting in situ since the mass deaths. I want to talk to those who live nearby, understand the events more clearly, bear witness, go into the heart of darkness. Perhaps the salient question to ask oneself before planning such a trip is: What is the intention? Is it to learn and understand? Or is it merely to scratch the itch of a morbid curiosity? Think about the locals, of the friends and family who are connected to the tragedy and ask whether visiting honors a legacy or exploits a tragedy. In the end, you may be the only one who can judge the ethics of visiting these places.\n",

            "TheMiss Netherlandsbeautypageanthas been scrapped, after the competition’s organizers said it was time for change. The contest will no longer run, and in its place those behind it have introduced a new initiative aimed at “inspiring” young people in many different ways. The move comes just over a year after the contest’s judges crowned its first ever trans woman winner, Rikkie Kollé. A statement on the competition’swebsiteannounced its closure and the establishment of a new platform called “Niet Meer Van Deze Tijd” (“No Longer of This Time”). It states: “After years of history full of glamor, talent and inspiration, Miss Netherlands is saying goodbye to the name that found itself in many people’s hearts. But this is not the end; it is a new beginning. The world is changing, and we are changing with it. “Miss Netherlands is transforming intoNo Longer of this Time: a platform that revolves around mental health, social media, diversity, self-expression and much more. No more crowns, but stories that connect. No dresses, but dreams that come to life. “Here we inspire young people to be themselves in a world that is constantly changing.” In a statement sent to CNN, Monica van Ee, director of Miss Netherlands and founder of the new platform, said: “Women are insecure due to, among other things, the rise of social media and its unreal images of beauty.” Defending the contest’s record to date, she said her team had “worked intensively with participants” over the years, and that the e﻿mpowerment of women was not just “empty words but a movement.” The viewer feedback has become increasingly difficult to manage, however. Van Ee said the reason for dropping the “castings and finals” initially arose from “the obstinacy of the spectator” and criticisms like “she is too White” or “she is too Black.” “This leads to negative energy every year,” she said. “Secondly, we would like to use our positive energy instead of always having to get defensive. Now we can reach everyone and provide the right solidarity. We believe in our platform and perhaps a sash and a crown are outdated. But women who support each other and help each other, that has always been important to us!” Kollé, who was one of two trans women who went on to compete in Miss Universe 2023, used her influence to promote a more inclusive vision of the pageant world. In a video posted to Instagram last year, she said: “Miss Universe asked us to describe ourselves in one word. “The word I’m choosing is ‘victory,’ because as a little boy I conquered all the things that came through my path — and look at me now, standing here as a strong, empowering and confident trans woman.” The beauty pageant world has been forced to modernize in recent years, as the values the shows traditionally embraced do not chime with younger generations. This year’s Miss Universe, held in Mexico City last month, admitted women aged over 28 for the first time ever. It followed moves last year to lift the ban on including pregnant women or mothers, and women who are — or have ever been — married. That rule still stands in some pageants, however. Back in September, a New York woman submitted a complaint to the city’s Commission on Human Rights seeking an end to the exclusion of mothers. The Miss Universe organization came under scrutiny earlier this year as the  parent company of Miss USA. In May, Miss USA and Miss Teen USA resigned within days of one another amid allegations of mismanagement, toxicity and conditions that impacted their mental health.\n",

            "“I’ve been thinking in the past few years: Will I die away from my country?” Abdulaziz Almashi said, reciting the question that he andmillions of displaced Syrianshave asked themselves. “Will I be able to go back and see my mum and dad again?” For years, they had seemed distant hopes. But hours after Bashar al-Assad’sbrutal regime collapsed, Almashi braved stormy weather to celebrate in his new home of London, surrounded by hundreds of ecstatic compatriots. “It’s just a dream,” he told CNN, after organizing a rally in the city’s historic Trafalgar Square. “It is emotional, and it’s sinking in: Really, Assad is gone.” Almashi has lived in Britain since 2009, unable to return to Syria due to his political activism and his outspoken opposition to the deposed dictator. He gained refugee status, now holds British citizenship, and has set up London’s Syria Solidarity Campaign (SSC). “Both my grandmothers passed away while I’ve been (in London),” he said. “I wasn’t there to say my goodbye. I was wondering whether I’ll ever be able to see her grave and lay flowers.” Now, it all feels possible. “I would like to go back to my country as soon as possible … I really want to be part of the future of Syria.” But Almashi’s enthusiasm was punctured quickly. Amid uncertainty over the future of Syria’s government, Britain – along with Germany, Austria, Ireland and a host of other European countries – said they wouldsuspend decisions on Syrian asylum claims. Austriaalso said it would look at deporting people back to Syria. It was a sudden response that those governments said was necessary to take stock of a rapidly changing situation in the country. But it unsettled much of Syria’s huge diaspora in Europe, particularly those with outstanding asylum claims or who did not gain citizenship in their adopted countries. More than a million Syrians live across the continent, many of them arriving amid the 2015 migrant crisis that broke out as a result of the country’s civil war. And it comes just as governments across Europe harden their stances on migration in an effort to quell surging support for populist and far-right forces, who have linked increases in migration to the availability of housing, health care and public services. “They really ruined the happiness of so many Syrians across Europe,” Almashi of the continent’s leaders. “What shocked me most is how quick this decision was.” Human rights groups including Amnesty International criticized leaders for pausing asylum processing. But the UN’s refugee agencysaidit was acceptable, as long as Syrians could still apply for asylum, noting the situation on the ground is “uncertain and highly fluid.” In Germany, which took in more than a million Syrian refugees after 2015, the coming weeks feel particularly tense.Asylum processing there is paused; the country’s opposition leader, expected to take power in February’s election, has in the past raised the prospect of returning Syrians in the country. Neighboring Austria went a step further. “I have instructed the ministry to prepare an orderly repatriation and deportation program to Syria,” Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said this week. Family reunions have also been suspended, the ministry said. Roughly 95,000 Syrians live in Austria, according to the ministry. So far this year, almost 13,000 asylum requests have been lodged. The conversations are “incomprehensible,” said Tareq Alaows, a Syrian-German who came to the country as a refugee in 2015. “Emotionally, many Syrians long to return and actively participate in the reconstruction of their country. But rationally speaking, the situation remains extremely uncertain.” “There are great hopes for a democratic Syria, but for this we need the support of the international community – including from German politics,” he added. “Instead, we are confronted with deportation debates that greatly unsettle and sometimes even retraumatize many Syrians.” There is some irony that, nearly a decade after the migrant crisis prompted a populist backlash, the fall of Syria’s dictatorship has coincided with its resurgence. Centrist politicians across Europe have toughened their migration policies in recent months, spooked by the electoral success of charismatic right-wing and anti-migrant leaders. Syrians have contributed to several European economies; Syrian people make up the largest group of foreign doctors in Germany, with around 10,000 working in its hospitals, according to Syrian Society for Doctors and Pharmacists in Germany. “If large numbers were to leave the country, care provision would not collapse, but there would be noticeable gaps,” Gerald Gass, the chairman of the German Hospital Federation, told Reuters. But inflation, housing shortages and strained services have fueled frustration at migrant and refugee populations in many European countries, and the unrest hasmanifested itself at the ballot boxin Britain, France, Germany, Italy and several others. “The situation with migration in Europe at the moment is quite dire,” said Kay Marsh, a community engagement coordinator at British charity Samphire. Her group works with refugees in the coastal town of Dover, the landing spot for many of the small boats that carry asylum seekers across the Channel to Britain. “There will be people that will be looking at (Assad’s fall) as a way to get rid of people,” she predicted. The conversations are beginning at a time when Syria’s governance is unclear. Many Western countries classify the triumphant rebel group Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS) as a terrorist organization, and the country’s years-long war has left infrastructure and basic necessities in short supply. “It is way too early to be able to understand what the situation is on the ground in Syria,” said Yasmine Nahlawi, a London-based legal consultant whose work has focused on the application of international legal frameworks to the conflict in Syria. “There are still so many security issues that have to be assessed,” she said, calling the decisions of European governments “insulting” to Syrians. For now, most Syrians in Europe are intent on celebrating the fall of a regime that had seemed unshakable as recently as a month ago. “It’s something that I never even thought of happening,” said Esther Baleh, a 22-year-old London-based fashion designer who fled Syria with her family in 2014. As Assad fled Damascus, Baleh and her friends “started calling each other and congratulating each other,” she said. “I felt like my identity had been rebuilt.” As for Almashi and many Syrians across Europe, there is caution amid Baleh’s excitement. “Right now, there is no safe place” in Syria to return to, she said. But “potentially, once I know it’s safe,” she added; “it would be my dream to go back and rebuild my country.”\n",
            "https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/15/africa/mayotte-cyclone-chido-death-toll-intl-latam/index.html\n",
            "The death toll in the French territory of Mayotte fromCyclone Chidois “several hundred” and may run into the thousands, the island’s top government official told a local broadcaster Sunday. France rushed rescue teams and supplies to its largely poor overseas department in the Indian Ocean that has suffered widespread destruction. “I think there are some several hundred dead, maybe we’ll get close to a thousand. Even thousands … given the violence of this event,″ Mayotte Prefect François-Xavier Bieuville told TV station Mayotte la 1ere. He had previously said it was the worst cyclone to hit Mayotte in 90 years. Bieuville said it was extremely difficult to get an exact number of deaths and injuries after Mayotte was pummeled by the intense tropical cyclone on Saturday, causing major damage to public infrastructure, including the airport, flattening neighborhoods and knocking out electricity supplies. The French Interior Ministry confirmed at least 11 deaths and more than 250 injuries earlier Sunday but said that was expected to increase substantially. Mayotte in the southwestern Indian Ocean off the coast of Africa is France’s poorest island and the poorest territory in the European Union. It has a population of just over 300,000 spread over two main islands. Bieuville said the worst devastation had been seen in the slums of metal shacks and informal structures that mark much of Mayotte. Referring to the official death toll so far, he said ″this figure is not plausible when you see the images of the slums.” “I think the human toll is much higher,” he added. Chido blew through the southwestern Indian Ocean on Friday and Saturday, also affecting the nearby islands of Comoros and Madagascar. Mayotte was directly in the cyclone’s path, though, and took the brunt. Chido brought winds in excess of 220 kph (136 mph), according to the French weather service, making it a category 4 cyclone, the second strongest on the scale. Later, Chido made landfall in Mozambique on the African mainland and there were fears for more than 2 million people in the country’s north who could be impacted, according to authorities there. French President Emmanuel Macron said his “thoughts” were with the Mayotte people and Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau was due to travel to Mayotte on Monday. Retailleau had warned Saturday night after an emergency meeting in Paris that the death toll “will be high,” while new Prime Minister François Bayrou, who took office on Friday, said infrastructure had been severely damaged or destroyed across Mayotte. Pope Francis offered prayers for the victims while on a visit Sunday to the French Mediterranean island of Corsica. Rescuers and firefighters were sent from France and the nearby French territory of Reunion and supplies were also rushed in on military aircraft and ships. Damage to the airport’s control tower meant only military aircraft were able to fly in. Patrice Latron, the prefect of Reunion, said authorities aim to establish an air and sea bridge from Reunion to Mayotte. About 800 more rescuers were to be sent in the coming days and more than 80 tons of supplies had been flown in or were on their way by ship. Some of the priorities were restoring electricity and access to drinking water, Latron said. The French Interior Ministry said 1,600 police and gendarmerie officers have been deployed to “help the population and prevent potential looting.” In some parts of Mayotte, entire neighborhoods of metal shacks and huts were flattened, while residents reported trees had been uprooted, boats flipped or sunk and many areas were without power. Chad Youyou, a resident in Hamjago in the north of the island, posted videos on Facebook showing the extensive damage in his village and across the surrounding fields and hills, where almost every tree had been leveled. “Mayotte is destroyed … we are destroyed,” he said. Chido continued its eastern trajectory and into northern Mozambique where it continued to cause serious damage, while farther inland landlocked Malawi and Zimbabwe warned they might have to evacuate people because of flooding. In Mozambique, UNICEF said Cabo Delgado province, home to around 2 million people, was the first region to be hit and many homes, schools and health facilities have been partially or completely destroyed. UNICEF Mozambique spokesman Guy Taylor said that communities faced the prospect of being cut off from schools and health facilities for weeks and Mozambique authorities warned there was a high danger of landslides. December through to March is cyclone season in the southwestern Indian Ocean and southern Africa has been pummeled by a series of strong ones in recent years. Cyclone Idai in 2019 killed more than 1,300 people, mostly in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Cyclone Freddy left more than 1,000 dead across several countries in the Indian Ocean and southern Africa last year. The cyclones bring the risk of flooding and landslides, but also stagnant pools of water may later spark deadly outbreaks of the waterborne disease cholera as well as dengue fever and malaria. Studies say the cyclones are getting worse because of climate change. They can leave poor countries in Africa, which contribute a tiny amount to global warming, having to deal with large humanitarian crises, underlining their call for more help from rich nations to deal with the impact of climate change.\n",

            "The remaining five Australians from the infamous “Bali Nine” drug gangare “relieved and happy” to be home after Canberra struck a deal with Jakartato end their two decades of imprisonment. The five, who were serving life sentences, belong to a wider group of nine who were caught attempting to smuggle more than 8 kilograms (17.6 pounds) of heroinout of Bali’s international airport and into Australia in 2005. They were freed and sent home on Sunday. “I am pleased to confirm that Australian citizens, Si Yi Chen, Michael Czugaj, Matthew Norman, Scott Rush and Martin Stephens have returned toAustraliathis afternoon,” Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese wrote on X on Sunday. In a statement, the five men and their families said they were “immensely grateful” to the Indonesian president and his government for their release. They also thanked their friends and lawyers, as well as the Australian authorities. “The five men are relieved and happy to be back in Australia. They look forward, in time, to reintegrating back into and contributing to society,” it said. The botched plot has long been a point of tension between the two countries with the Australian government advocating for their return for decades. Indonesia executed the group’s two Australian ringleaders Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran in 2015, prompting then Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott to call it “adark moment in the relationship.” Last month, Albanese raised the men’s case to Indonesia’s newly sworn in President Prabowo Subianto on the sidelines of the APEC Summit in Peru, Reuters reported. Indonesia’s Law Minister had confirmed at the time that it had agreed to return the remaining men, the agency said. “I thank President Prabowo Subianto for his compassion,” Albanese wrote on X on Sunday. The five members are now set to be free, Nine News reported. In a separate joint statement with Albanese and Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke on Sunday, Foreign Minister Penny Wong said, “The men will have the opportunity to continue their personal rehabilitation and reintegration in Australia.” The Bali Nine were arrested in 2005 by Indonesian police following a tip from Australian authorities. Four of them were arrested at Denpasar International Airport with over 8 kilograms of heroin strapped to their bodies, while another four were found at a hotel on the island of Kuta. Chan, one of the ringleaders, was captured after boarding a plane to Sydney. Chan and Sukumaran were sentenced to death while the other seven were eventually handed a life sentence after an appeal. The only female member of the group, Renae Lawrence,was freed in 2018after serving 13 years of her 20-year sentence. Lawrence had initially been sentenced to life in prison, but later her punishment was commuted to 20 years and she was released early on good behavior. Another member, Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen, died of kidney cancer in 2018 while in custody, Nine News reported. The case of the Bali Nine highlighted the strict laws on drug trafficking in Indonesia, where several foreigners are currently detained on similar charges.\n",

            "In the depths of Covid, Aamir Khan tried walking away from it all. Acting, filmmaking; the business that made him a household name to millions inIndiaand beyond. No more. The Bollywood megastar,one of India’s highest paid actors, was locked down in 2020 and feeling introspective. “I’d spent all my adult life in this magical world of cinema. And I was so lost in stories and characters and that whole journey that I realized I had not been there for my family,” Khan told CNN during a recent visit to London. “It was a major moment for me,” he said. “My three kids, two of them already adults, and I pretty much missed their childhoods. All of that really made me feel horrible about myself and how I’d conducted my life.” “I’m quite an extreme person,” he added, “so I was like, ‘OK, ‘I’m done with films now.’” Khan still had half a film left to shoot, which had been halted by the pandemic. He told no one of his plans beyond his family, which begs the question: if he kept it secret, did he really retire? “I did,” he insisted. “I used to go to work with my daughter — she runs a nonprofit company working in mental health … Really, I was having a great time.” Eventually his kids had a quiet word (“We can’t spend 24 hours a day with you, you need to get a life of your own,” as the actor tells it) pushing him back into the arms of Bollywood. And until recently, the rest of the world was none the wiser. So, though you might not have missed him, Aamir Khan has returned — only this time he’s making sure he’s home for supper. Khan is busy promoting “Lost Ladies” (“Laapataa Ladies”), which he produced. Directed by Kiran Rao, who is also Khan’s ex-wife,it tells the story of two veiled brides who accidentally go home with the wrong grooms as they travel back from their respective weddings. The light satire, playing on Netflix, is India’s official submission to the Academy Awards and BAFTAs. The movie features Nitanshi Goel and Pratibha Ranta as brides Phool and Jaya — one young and somewhat naïve, the other ambitious and independent. Phool becomes separated from husband Deepak (Sparsh Shrivastava). He in turn is distraught to learn the other bride Jaya has used the mix-up to flee her own husband, a sinister character who may have killed his first wife, and who refuses to let his second wife further her education. “The film organically spoke to so many issues that girls go through thanks to deeply entrenched patriarchy and gender roles and the lack of freedoms that women experience in so many parts of the world,” said director Rao. Khan brought the script to Rao, who set about injecting some laughs. “Humor is one thing that both of us really wanted to bring into the film. It really softens you, and (for) people who otherwise may not be of your point of view, it makes it easier for them to get it,” Khan said. (Using cinema to sway hearts and minds is a subject which Khan returns to often.) Khan and Rao met on the set of Oscar-nominee “Lagaan” (2001) and were married for 15 years, divorcing in 2021. Clearly still on good terms, theirs is a collaboration that has endured. “I think it starts with the fact that we both really enjoy each other’s minds,” said Rao. They’re presenting a united front in the lead up to the Oscars, where they hope to break a notable winless streak for the movie-mad nation. India has never been recognized for Best International Feature Film (previously Best Foreign Language Film), and only won its first Academy Award in 2023, when“RRR” walked away with Best Original Song. Khan is lending considerable clout to the campaign, marking a rare occasion he enters awards season mode. The actor is known for steering clear of such endeavors at home (“You’ll have to come to one of the Indian awards to understand that better,” he quipped) and admits he doesn’t “usually take awards that seriously.” But the Oscars offer something different: “It really opens up many windows for your film … I think as creative people, we really want more and more people to experience what we’ve done.” The elephant in the room is that more than one film from the subcontinent is eyeing up awards this season. Cannes Grand Prix-winner “All We Imagine as Light” by independent film director Payal Kapadia had been viewed as the lead candidate for Best International Film at the Oscars by some members of the Hollywood commentariat, only for the Film Federation of India (FFI) to choose otherwise. The ensuing bruhaha was only fueled by reported comments from the jury head that Kapadia’s felt like a “European film taking place in India, not an Indian film taking place in India.” But that film can always be submitted for other categories, and not all awards operate by the same submission rules as the Academy. “It’s a really interesting and exciting moment in Indian cinema when we see two women (making) films that speak about women’s journeys and struggles,” commented Rao. “In fact, both films actually address sisterhood and solidarity among women — and I think that really deserves celebration.” “There’s much more space for all of us, rather than to pit anyone against the other,” she added. Khan’s brief hiatus has prompted new priorities. The actor says he wants to produce more in the next decade, becoming “a platform for young talent.” That doesn’t mean nurturing the next generation of stars, he clarifies. After more than 40 years in the game , he’s still not sure what stardom is. “We can’t place our finger on it,” said the actor. “Why do people love me and Salman (Khan) and Shah Rukh (Khan)? Why not someone else? What’s is that we have? I have no idea.” The trio known as the Three Khans have dominated Bollywood for 30 years. And Aamir has an update: the three are finally ready to share a screen. “Last year we were sitting together and I said, ‘Listen, before we all retire, we have to do one film together otherwise audiences will be really upset with us,’” Khan shared. “All three of us are looking forward to that,” he added. “All three of us have the responsibility of looking out for this one script that all of us can star in. I’m hoping it happens sometime soon.” If it does, the movie would be a once-in-a-generation event for Hindi cinema, and a boost for Khan. While Salman and Shah Rukh starred in 2023 action hits “Pathaan” and “Tiger 3,” Aamir’s latest, 2022’s big-budget “Forrest Gump” remake “Laal Singh Chaddha” faltered with audiences, and the actor hasn’t had a hit since 2016 sensation “Dangal” —the first non-English language film to earn more than $300 million at the global box office. (Not that a hit couldn’t necessarily come sooner — Khan has half a dozen filmsin various stages of production.) Khan has weathered rough patches before. After his 1988 breakthrough “Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak” “I had a string of flops,” he recalled. “I was being called a one film wonder — and rightly so, I was doing awful work.” In retrospect, those flops — eight or nine of them, he estimates — were the learning curve he needed. “I realized the hard way that filmmaking is one person’s vision, and that one person is the director,” he explained. “Which director you work with will really determine where your film ends up.” “I told myself that unless the script, the director and the producer are something I have complete trust in, I’m not going to do a film ever again — even if that means the end of my career. And my career almost ended as a result of that,” he added. Yes, Khan agrees a movie star can grab a film by the scruff of its neck, “But why would you want to do that?” he said, looking bemused. “I don’t want to be in a film that’s not appreciated … Also, I don’t like people praising me more than the film. When I’m in a film and someone says, ‘Oh, you were fantastic,’ and he doesn’t talk about the film, I’m like, ‘So the film didn’t work for him.’ For me, the film is most important. I come in much later.” When Khan speaks, people listen. This fact has become a double-edged sword for the actor. Leveraging his leading man status to advocate for various social causes has come with inevitable detractors. “It’s a tough one,” Khan said, of the responsibilities of using his voice. “I’ve been learning that sometimes you need to speak, and sometimes you don’t.” The actor says he tries to stay away from the “cacophony” of social media, “where almost anything that you say could be offensive to somebody.” “Experience has taught me that it’s much better to communicate through a film,” Khan added. “What I want to convey, I can convey through my stories.” What message to place inside theempathy machineof cinema has become a thorny issue in India. The power of Hindi cinema to sway public opinion has been in the spotlight, with some arguing Bollywood has “veered toward the right” during the rule of Prime MinisterNarendra Modiand hisHindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP).Though their directors have denied it was their intention, popular films like “The Kerala Story” (2023) and “The Kashmir Files” (2022) have been criticized for perceived Islamophobia. Khan, a Muslim, who has played Hindus and Sikhs on screen, is a prominent avatar for a religiously pluralistic India. It was recently the 25th anniversary of “Sarfarosh” (1999) a beloved crime thriller which put the subject in the spotlight. Khan played Ajay, a Hindu police assistant commissioner in Mumbai charged with uncovering a gun-running operation designed to provoke civil unrest in India. Assisting him is steadfast officer Salim, played by Mukesh Rishi, whose allegiances are doubted because of his Muslim faith. Their fractious relationship comes to a head when Salim confronts Ajay, telling him, “Don’t you ever tell any Salim that this country isn’t his.” “It is still very relevant,” Khan reflected. “I thought ‘Sarfarosh’ was a really lovely script, and I think it was saying such important things — and saying it with so much love and sincerity that it really connected across the board in India.” “You want society to be inclusive. You don’t want any one section of society to feel insecure or worried, irrespective of where you are in the world, irrespective of which culture you’re talking about,” he added. Khan is a great believer that what happens in the movie theater doesn’t stay in the movie theater. “Creative people, their fundamental responsibility is to entertain,” he said, “but I don’t think that it ends there for me.” “You can also provoke (an audience). You can make them think. You can shed light on certain things,” he added. “It’s the creative people in society — the poets, the writers, the performing artists, dancers, painters — who really build the social fabric of any society. What I am today is largely a result of the effects of songs, paintings, poems, books, stories,films. All of that has affected me in some way or the other, and it’s made me who I am.” It’s a message anyone in the arts can get behind, including, he’ll hope, the Academy. Could “Lost Ladies” go all the way? Competition is stiff, but rule out a good awards season narrative at your peril. However, as Khan has come to appreciate, there’s more to life than awards and films. “It’s been an interesting journey these last three years, where I’ve come full circle. But now I’m in a much happier space — and I’m glad I didn’t quit.” “Lost Ladies” (“Laapataa Ladies”) is available to stream on Netflix.\n",
            "https://www.cnn.com/2013/05/30/weather/hurricane-season-fast-facts/index.html\n",
            "Hereâs a look at theAtlantic hurricane season, which runs fromJune 1 to November 30. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) defines a hurricane asâan intense tropical weather system with well-defined circulation and sustained winds of 74 mph (64 knots) or higher.â In the western North Pacific Ocean, hurricanes are called typhoons while similar storms in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific Ocean are called cyclones. The peak of the Atlantic season is from mid-August to late October. Hurricanes are rated according to intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. The 1-5 scale estimates potential property damage due to maximum sustained wind speed. A Category 3 or higher is considered a major hurricane. A hurricane watch indicates the possibility that a region could experience hurricane conditions within 48 hours. A hurricane warning indicates that tropical-storm-force winds of at least 74 mph are expected within 36 hours. There are four stages of development:tropical disturbance, tropical depression, tropical storm and hurricane (tropical cyclone). Tropical disturbance: Cloud columns develop into a cluster of thunderstorms. Tropical depression: Thunderstorms intensify, with maximum sustained winds of 38 mph or less. Tropical storm: Maximum sustained winds are between 39-73 mph. During this time, the storm becomes more circular in shape, with winds swirling around a calm center, known as the eye. This is when the storm is named. Hurricane: Wind speeds reach maximum sustained winds of 74 mph. Winds 74-95 mph. Storm surge 3-5 feet. No significant damage to buildings. Damage primarily to unanchored homes, shrubbery and trees. Some damage to poorly constructed signs and coastal road flooding. Damage to power lines and poles could result in power outages lasting a few to several days. Winds 96-110 mph. Storm surge 6-8 feet. Some damage to buildings, mainly roofs, doors and windows. Considerable damage to shrubbery and trees. Major damage to mobile homes. Extensive damage to poorly constructed signs and considerable damage to piers. Small crafts in unprotected anchorages may break moorings. Power outages could last from several days to weeks. Winds 111-130 mph. Storm surge 9-12 feet. Some structural damage to small buildings. Many large trees blown down. Rampant destruction of mobile homes in storms ranked category 3 or higher. Serious coastal flooding, damaging or destroying structures along the water. Evacuation of low-lying residences within several blocks of the shoreline may be required. Electricity and water may be unavailable for several days to weeks. Winds 131-155 mph. Storm surge 13-18 feet. Extensive building damage. Shrubs, trees and signs are blown down.  Major damage to lower floors of buildings near coastline due to flooding, battering waves and floating debris. Major beach erosion. Power outages could last from weeks to possibly months. Areas may be uninhabitable for weeks or months. Winds greater than 155 mph. Storm surge higher than 18 feet. Complete roof failure on many residences and industrial buildings. Widespread destruction of structures less than 15 feet above sea level within 500 yards of shore. Low-lying evacuation routes cut off by rising water 3 to 5 hours before hurricane center arrives. Advance evacuation of residential areas on low ground within 5-10 miles of the shoreline may be required. Power outages could last for months. Area may remain uninhabitable for months. There are 10 regional lists of names worldwide:Atlantic, Eastern North Pacific, Central North Pacific, Western North Pacific/South China Sea, Australian Region, Nadi, Port Moresby, Jakarta, Southwest Indian Ocean and Northern Indian Ocean. Using womenâs names for Atlantic storms was the practice until 1979, when male names were added to the mix. The World Meteorological Organizationâs Hurricane Committee creates lists of hurricane names that are recycled every six years. Names associated with storms that have caused significant death and/or damage are retired from the list.After the 2021 season, the name Ida was retired. Some other names that have been removed include Camille (1969), Andrew (1992), Floyd (1999), Katrina (2005), Ike (2008), Sandy (2012), Maria (2017) and Ian (2022). Once a name is removed, another name replaces it.\n",

            "A crucial dam is at risk as fighting continues in several areas of northernSyriabetween Kurdish groups and Turkish-backed factions. While much of central and southern Syria appears calm afteropposition forcesoverthrew the Assad regime, a patchwork of territorial rivalries in the north has exploded into open combat, sparking concerns ISIS could exploit the deteriorating security situation. Most of the clashes involve Kurdish groups under the banner of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and pro-Turkish elements of the Free Syrian Army (FSA), which are part of the broader coalition that ousted Bashar al-Assad. While a four-day ceasefire in the city of Manbij was announced on Thursday, fighting has continued to its south, especially around the Tishreen Dam, despite the truce stipulating that both sides should withdraw from the area. The SDF said Friday that after three days of fighting around the dam and an important bridge across the Euphrates river, its forces had driven back “the mercenaries’ attacks.” It claimed to have killed more than 200 enemy fighters while losing only eight. However, video surfaced Friday purporting to show fighters from a Turkish-backed group in control of the bridge over the dam. CNN cannot verify the numbers nor the state of the frontlines near the dam. Some experts have expressed concern that the fighting could damage the dam and cause extensive flooding of more than 40 villages downstream. The UN has warned the dam’s structural integrity is at risk. The United Nations Children’s Fund representative to Syria, Yasumasa Kimura, told CNN that a water treatment facility nearby had no power, which could lead to a “complete water cut” to more than three million people in the Aleppo area, he said. Further south in the city of Raqqa, which is controlled by the SDF, clashes erupted Thursday after hundreds took to the streets to celebrate the Assad regime falling. One person was killed and 15 wounded in the resulting gunfire and stampede, according to a local journalist and witnesses. Some residents in Raqqa have called on the SDF to hand over control of the city to the FSA. The majority of Raqqa’s population is Arab with Kurds being the minority. There were no reports of further unrest in Raqqa Friday. The SDF has been a US ally since 2017 in the battle to eradicate ISIS, the terror group which at one point held a large swathe of northern Syria. But the Turkish government has long regarded Syrian Kurdish groups as part of or linked to the PKK, a militant Kurdish group that has carried out many attacks in Turkey over the last three decades. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in Ankara Friday meeting with his Turkish counterpart Hakan Fidan to discuss the situation in Syria – and the risk that renewed conflict in the north could provide an opening for ISIS’ revival. The SDF and other Kurdish elements have controlled several enclaves in northern Syria since regime control in the north evaporated when ISIS was at its height in 2015. In the far north-east of the country, near the Iraqi border, the SDF controls a large detention camp at Al Hol for relatives of ISIS fighters, as well as other facilities where suspected ISIS militants are held. Blinken has acknowledged this role, saying the SDF has been “critical to guarding the detention facilities where thousands of foreign terrorist fighters have been detained for years, keeping them off of the battlefield.” Analysts say that the sectarian conflict in the north will be hard to contain, with Armed Conflict Location & Event Data commenting that the clashes reflect a “broader struggle over territorial control and political dominance in northern Syria.” It added that ISIS “is poised to exploit the resulting security vacuum, potentially turning the central desert into a hotspot of conflict.” Jennifer Hansler contributed reporting from Ankara.

            "A California couple visiting Mexico for the holidays was shot and killed on Wednesday when armed gunmen fired on their vehicle, according to authorities. Rafael and Gloria Cardona were visiting family in Angamacutiro, Michoacan state at the time of the attack, a US official told CNN. The woman died at the scene and the man died shortly after in the hospital. Their three children, two of whom are minors, were not present during the shooting and are currently with extended family in Angamacutiro, the US official said. The US State Department is in contact with their adult daughter. Rafael Cardona’s brother-in-law is Hermes Arnulfo Pacheco Bribiesca, a Mexican government official in Amangcutiro who assumed office after the kidnapping and murder of his predecessor in late October, according to the US official. According to a statement Rafael Cardona’s brother, Cesar, gave to local police, the couple were driving Hermes’ van when they were killed, the US official said. The motive for the attack has not been confirmed by Mexican authorities. The couple had arrived in the Pacific coast state on November 30, local authorities said earlier. In a statement sent to CNN, a US State Department spokesperson confirmed the death of both US citizens and offered their “sincerest condolences to their families for their loss.” “We are closely monitoring local authorities’ investigation into the reported killings,” the spokesperson said. A mass will be held in Angamacutiro Saturday to commemorate the couple, local authorities said. The municipality has canceled all celebrations for the rest of the month, authorities added. Michoacan has been long affected by gang violence, with cartels moving into the state in the 1980s. Its homicide rate today is more than twice the country’s average. Nationally, Mexico’shomicide rateis among the highest in the world. The state is alsoMexico’s largest grower of avocados– a market long troubled by violent groups and corrupt public authorities, researchers at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime said in a report this year. Nearly three-quarters of Mexican avocados come from Michoacán. Gangs such as the Zetas and Familia Michoacana were formed in the state, which has become home to drug production and drug traffickers who target local farmers to cultivate marijuana and other drugs, according to areportfrom Insight Crime. More than 100,000 people remain missing in the country,with no explanation of their fate. According to think tankMexico Evalua,around 95%of all crimes nationwide went unsolved in the country in 2022.

Mount St. Helens is located in Washington, about 55 miles northeast of Portland, Oregon, and 95 miles south of Seattle. It is administered by theNational Forest Service, not the National Park Service. Over the last 500 years, Mount St. Helens has had at least four major explosive eruptions and many minor eruptions. Mount St. Helens was named by Commander George Vancouver for British diplomat Alleyne Fitzherbert, whose title was Baron St. Helens. 1792-1794 -The mountain is named while Commander Vancouver is surveying the northern Pacific coast. 1835 -Is first recognized as avolcano. 1857-1980 -Is inactive.

            "A former South Korean defense minister was formally arrested Wednesday (local time) over his alleged collusion withPresident Yoon Suk Yeoland others in imposing martial law last week, as authorities investigate whether their acts amount to rebellion. Martial law, the first in more than 40 years, lasted only about six hours but has triggered a domestic firestorm and large street protests. Yoon and his associates face criminal investigations and impeachment attempts. The Justice Ministry has banned Yoon and eight others fromleaving the countryas authorities see them as key suspects in the martial law case. It’s the first time that a sitting president in South Korea has received a travel ban. The Seoul Central District Court said it approved an arrest warrant for former Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun on charges of rebellion and abuse of power. Kim has been detained since Sunday. Prosecutors have up to 20 days to determine whether to indict him. A conviction on the charge of rebellion carries a maximum death sentence. Kim became the first person arrested over the case. He has been accused of recommending martial law to Yoon and sending troops to the National Assembly to block lawmakers from voting on it. Enough lawmakers eventually managed to enter a parliament chamber and unanimously rejected Yoon’s decree, forcing the Cabinet to lift it before daybreak on Dec. 4. Kim said in a statement Tuesday that he “deeply apologizes for causing significant anxiety and inconvenience.” He said all responsibility for the imposition of martial law rests solely with him and pleaded for leniency for soldiers deployed to enforce it, saying they were only following his order. Prosecutors reportedly accuse Kim of playing a key role in a rebellion and committing abuse of power by staging a riot to disrupt the constitution in collaboration with Yoon and other military and police officers. Prosecutors’ offices in Seoul couldn’t immediately confirm the reports. The opposition-controlled parliament passed a bill Tuesday to appoint an independent special counsel to investigate Yoon and other top military officials over the martial law introduction. The main opposition Democratic Party had advocated for a special counsel investigation, arguing that public prosecutors cannot be trusted to conduct a thorough investigation of Yoon, a former prosecutor-general. During a parliamentary hearing Tuesday, Kwak Jong-keun, commander of the Army Special Warfare Command whose troops were sent to parliament, testified that he received direct instructions from Kim Yong Hyun to obstruct lawmakers from entering the National Assembly’s main chamber. Kwak said the purpose of Kim’s instructions was to prevent the 300-member parliament from gathering the 150 votes necessary to overturn Yoon’s martial law order. Kwak said Yoon later called him directly and asked for the troops to “quickly destroy the door and drag out the lawmakers who are inside.” Kwak said he discussed Yoon’s order with the commander at the scene and that they concluded there was nothing that could be done, ruling out the possibility of threatening the lawmakers by shooting blanks or cutting off electricity. At the same hearing, senior officer Kim Dae-woo of the military’s counterintelligence agency said his commander, Yeo In-hyung, asked him if an army bunker in Seoul had space to detain politicians and other figures after martial law was imposed. Yeo is considered a close associate of Kim Yong Hyun. Last week, Hong Jang-won, a deputy director of the country’s spy agency, said Yoon ordered him to help Yeo’s command to detain some of his political rivals but he ignored the president’s order. Kwak and Yeo are among those who face opposition-raised rebellion charges along with Yoon and Kim, and the Defense Ministry suspended them last week. Opposition parties and many experts say the martial law decree was unconstitutional. They say a president is by law allowed to declare martial law only during “wartime, war-like situations or other comparable national emergency states” and South Korea wasn’t in such a situation. They argue that deploying troops to seal the National Assembly to suspend its political activities amounted to rebellion because the South Korean Constitution doesn’t allow a president to use the military to suspend parliament in any situation. In his martial law announcement, the conservative Yoon stressed a need to rebuild the country by eliminating “shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces,” a reference to his liberal rivals who control parliament. Yoon avoided impeachment on Saturday after most governing party lawmakers boycotted a floor vote in the National Assembly. The Democratic Party said it would prepare for a new vote on Yoon’s impeachment on Saturday. The party on Tuesday submitted motions to impeach Yoon’s police chief and justice minister as well. It pushed to impeach Kim Yong Hyun and the safety minister, but they resigned before parliament took a vote. If Yoon is impeached, his presidential powers would be suspended until the Constitutional Court decides whether to restore his powers or remove him from office. If it voted for removal, a new presidential election would be required.\n",

            "Seven tourists sought hospital treatment for suspected poisoning after drinking cocktails at a bar in an upscale Fiji resort that’s now being investigated by police. Four Australians, along with other three people believed to be foreign nationals, were taken to the hospital after being served drinks made at a bar at the Warwick Fiji on Saturday. The tourists, ages 18 to 56, suffered nausea, vomiting and “neurological symptoms,” according to a statement from Fiji’s Health Ministry. By late Monday, two remained in Lautoka Hospital’s intensive care unit in a stable condition. The others had been discharged, according to Fiji’s Deputy Prime Minister Viliame R. Gavoka. The case comes just weeks aftersix tourists died from methanol poisoningafter drinking at a bar in Laos, in a case that prompted safety warnings about consuming alcohol abroad. Asked whether methanol was to blame, Dr Jemesa Tudravu, permanent secretary for Fiji’s Ministry of Health & Medical Services, said it was too soon to tell. “We don’t have the results of the investigation yet and we don’t know if it was spiking or any other cause until we complete our investigations,” he said in a briefing Monday. Sydney resident David Sandoe told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation he’d received a call saying his daughter and granddaughter were among those hospitalized. He said they were among a group of people who drank a piña colada cocktail before falling ill. “There was a group of them in the lounge of this resort and they had a similar cocktail and unfortunately, seven people came down with the symptoms that have been talked about,” Sandoe said. He said his relatives were scheduled to fly home late Monday. Australian media reports suggested one of the ill tourists was American. The US embassy in Fiji told CNN that it was aware of the reports but had nothing to add. Gavoka, who is also Fiji’s tourism minister, assured travelers to the Pacific nation that the incident was “extremely isolated.” “No other incidents have been reported either at the resort, or across Fiji. The resort has been operating in Fiji successfully for many years and holds a strong reputation, particularly among our Australian visitors,” he said in a statement Monday. “The resort management has assured us that they have not engaged in practices such as substituting ingredients or altering the quality of drinks served to guests,” he added. The Warwick Hotels and Resorts operates luxury accommodation worldwide, including in the US, Europe and the Middle East. In Fiji, king suites offering views of palm trees and the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean cost roughly $500 a night. In a statement, Warwick Fiji said it was taking the matter “very seriously.” “At this moment, we do not have conclusive details, but we are committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of our guests,” the hotel said. Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers confirmed that four Australians were receiving support from department officials. He said the situation was “very concerning” and pointed to updated travel advice from the Department of Foreign Affairs to be wary of drink spiking and alcohol poisoning in Fiji. “Don’t leave your drinks unattended. Pay attention when your drinks are being mixed and get urgent medical help if you suspect that something is wrong,” he said. Gavoka said close to a million tourists visit the island every year and thousands of tourists were currently holidaying on the Pacific Island. “This is the only reported case of its kind that we’ve experienced in recent memory, and certainly nothing like this has been experienced this year,” he said. “While we understand the concern, we want to emphasize that the tourism experience in Fiji is typically very safe, and we have acted immediately to try and discover the cause of what made these guests, at this resort, fall ill.” In November, the deaths of two Australian teenagers, a British woman, an American man and two Danish women after drinking shots in Laos prompted warnings from several Western nations about the potentially fatal consequences of drinking tainted alcohol.\n",

            "Over the past three years, Elon Musk has met dozens of times with presidents, prime ministers, lawmakers, government officials and political candidates from around the world. Some of these meetings have been highly publicized, like his visit to Israel with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu following criticism over an antisemitic post Musk boosted on X. Other meetings, such as a recent conversation with Argentine President Javier Milei, the world only glimpses through the billionaire’s social media posts. Known topics of conversation ranged from business opportunities for Musk’s companies to elections and policy issues such as trade, energy, education and population management, according to a CNN review of Musk’s meetings, calls and conversations with political figures around the world since August 2021. Although some of his relationships with those leaders go back even further, in that time, Musk has gone from being one of the world’s wealthiest and most influential businessmen to an increasingly powerful player in global affairs. Taken together, the meetings show how Musk has been courted not only for his companies and deep pocketbook but also for his ability to impact the course of wars through hisStarlink satellite service;his opinion onartificial intelligence,the next major wave of technology development; and his role inswaying public opinionthrough his platform, X. On Friday, the Wall Street Journalreportedthat Musk has been in regular contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian government officials, including about Starlink, since late 2022. CNN has not independently confirmed the conversations, so they are not included in our analysis. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told CNN the report was “absolutely false.” He said Musk and Putin have only ever spoken once, adding that the conversation was over the phone and took place before 2022. Musk’s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment. For Musk, conversations with world leaders are a virtuous cycle: The six prominent companies he owns or runs give him an in with those figures, whose support often fuels their growth. In turn, those leaders’ interest in attracting Musk’s business provides an opportunity for him to advise on some of his other pet interests, such as global birth rates and immigration. At the same time, the South Africa-born billionaire has become a political power player in his adopted home, the United States. He held livestream campaign events on X for presidential hopefuls Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who both later dropped out of the race, as well as formerPresident Donald Trump.Musk has since thrown his weight — and tens of millions of dollars — behind Trump, attending and hosting rallies on his behalf and criticizing (and, in some cases, spreading false information about) his competitor, Vice President Kamala Harris, on X. “He’s trying to be a global influencer, and I guess he’s decided he needs to do more than use X,” said James Lewis, director of the strategic technologies program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Of course, it’s not unusual for corporate leaders to sometimes meet with government officials, and Musk is not the only big business name to publicly weigh in on the upcoming US presidential election. But the extent of Musk’s public political involvement is unusual for the chief executive of a public company like Tesla — as well as the owner of several powerful private firms, executive leadership experts told CNN. “What’s different about it is that there’s a political aspect, and most CEOs steer clear of politics,” Lewis said. “They’re going to the head of another state, basically, to make the commercial conditions better for their product, maybe to lobby on a certain point, but they don’t usually do politics,” he said, adding that with Musk, “there’s a political tone to everything he does.” At least some of Musk’s political relationships appear to have benefited his companies. In May 2022, Muskmetwith the then-President of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, to mark the launch of Starlink in the country, a major new market for the satellite business. In February 2023, he heldcallswith then-Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador about a new Tesla manufacturing plant in the state of Nuevo Leon, for which the company later received $153 million worth of incentives from the state. In May 2023, he held meetings with Chinese government officials shortly after Tesla announced plans for anew battery plantin Shanghai; Musk made asurprise returnto China this April for a visit with Premier Li Qiang, weeks before the company broke ground on the facility. Even more world leaders, includingFrench President Emmanuel Macron,Turkish President Recep Tayyip ErdoganandIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have met with Musk to ask Tesla to invest in their countries. CNN’s analysis includes only meetings for which at least some information is publicly available. It’s possible the billionaire has calls or meetings with leaders that he does not post about. “One might say he doesn’t have to pay lobbyists, because he’s his own lobbyist, globally,” said William Klepper, a professor of management at Columbia Business School who focuses on executive leadership. But, he added, “when you’ve got other people’s money at stake, you have to moderate your activities … when you get into these extremes, you can impact your business.” Musk has not hesitated to deal in extremes. He’swarnedof the downfall of America if Democrats are elected, pushed falseconspiracy theorieson topics such as mail-in voting and warned in public events of a “woke mind virus” that threatens society’s advancements. Separately, Musk has also taken heat for boosting anantisemitic conspiracy theory, racist false claims aboutimmigrationand the dangerous‘Pizzagate’conspiracy, as well as posting aHolocaust jokeon X. Recently, Musk’s political activism has begun to have a tangible impact on his companies: Brands pulled their advertisements from X,tanking its value.And SpaceX earlier this monthsued a California regulatorafter it allegedly denied a bid to allow more rocket launches over the billionaire’s controversial comments, claiming it had violated Musk’s freedom of speech. (The agency did not comment on the suit.) CNN’s analysis also suggests that Musk has, in particular, worked to develop influence among a set of right-leaning world leaders, including Modi, Bolsonaro, Milei and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. “He’s probably more comfortable with them … these are people who want to meet with him, and not everyone wants to meet with Elon Musk,” Lewis said. “It’s birds of a feather. He likes visiting people who are going to be pleased to be receiving Elon Musk.” During a conference for Italy’s far-right Brothers of Italy party last year, Musk railed against “illegal immigration” and the “woke mind virus” that he said was gripping the US. Musk called it “evil” and warned of it moving to Italy. India’s Modi, who was recentlyreelectedfor a rare third consecutive term, used his plans for electric vehicle manufacturing growth — including conversations with Musk about a potential Tesla factory — as acampaign talking point, although a meeting in India between the two men earlier this year where Musk was expected to announce the facility was rescheduled. Musk has also met with Milei multiple times in his first year leading Argentina, during which time the president hasfaced protestsover a huge spike in poverty rates as a result of austerity measures. “I recommend investing in Argentina,” Musk said in anX postfollowing a May meeting between the pair. In anotherpostlast month, Musk said, “Milei is bringing prosperity to Argentina.” (Argentina is home tohuge stores of lithium, an essential component in batteries like the ones used in Tesla’s cars.) Now, as he campaigns for Trump, Musk may be setting himself up for his most prominent political role yet: a position in a possible future Trump White House. Musk and Trump have publicly discussed having the billionaire lead a new government efficiency commission — which Musk has jokingly referred to as the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, the name of Musk’s favorite meme and cryptocurrency — if the former president is reelected. Methodology:CNN’s analysis is based on information compiled from news reports, X posts and press releases. It is possible other meetings exist, or other topics were discussed beyond what is publicly available. The position titles are as of the time of the meeting.\n",

            "An Israeli airstrike in Gaza killed an Al Jazeera photojournalist on Sunday – exactly one year to the day after an attack killed one of his colleagues. Ahmad Al-Louh, 39, and four other people were killed by the strike that targeted an office of the Civil Defense service in central Gaza’s Nuseirat Camp area, according to Al Awda Hospital, which treated the casualties. Al Jazeera has condemned the attack, saying Al-Louh was “brutally killed” while covering the service’s attempt to rescue a family that had been severely injured in an earlier bombing. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed it had targeted the Civil Defense offices in a “precise strike,” claiming the site was being used as a “command-and-control center” by Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists who were planning an “imminent terror attack against IDF troops.” It said Al-Louh was among those killed in the strike and alleged he was a “terrorist” who had previously served with Islamic Jihad. The IDF did not provide any proof for their allegations. In late July, an IDF strike killed Al Jazeera correspondent Ismail al-Ghoul, who it accused of being a Hamas member – an allegation the network slammed as “baseless.” CNN has reached out to Al Jazeera about the IDF’s allegations about Al-Louh. CNN footage shows ambulances taking the casualties to the hospital. Some of them are still wearing civil defense vests. It shows one motionless body being carried on a blanket being used as a makeshift stretcher. It also shows Al-Louh’s body on the floor, press vest draped over him, as people surround him. His brother Sajed leans over Al-Louh crying, “Hamada! Oh God,” addressing his deceased brother by nickname. According to the hospital, the other people killed in the strike were three Civil Defense workers and one civilian. A spokesperson for Gaza’s Civil Defense strongly denied the IDF’s claim of a terrorist presence at the site. “These teams work around the clock to rescue people. Everyone knows that the Civil Defense organization is a humanitarian body that provides services during both peace and war to civilians and has no political involvement. The team was directly targeted,” said Zaki Imad Eddine. Al Jazeera, which has in the past accused Israel of systematically targeting its journalists – a charge Israel denies, described Al-Louh’s killing as a crime and said it followed a pattern of attacks in which its workers had been killed or injured by Israeli attacks. It noted that Al-Louh’s death coincided with the first anniversary of the killing of one of its cameramen, Samer Abu Daqqa, who died on December 15, 2023, after sustaining injuries in anIsraeli attackon southern Gaza. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), Abu Daqqa was the first Al Jazeera journalist to have been killed in the Israel-Hamas war since the October 7 terror attack of 2023. Since then, a string of other journalists with the network have been killed or injured in Gaza, in disputed circumstances. On Sunday, Al Jazeera extended its condolences to Al-Louh’s wife and family, adding that just days earlier an Israeli strike had destroyed his house in the Da’wa neighborhood of Nuseirat Camp. The network also said it was committed to pursuing “all legal measures to prosecute the perpetrators of these crimes against journalists” and urged international legal institutions to take “urgent measures” to hold the Israeli authorities to account and “to put an end to the targeting and killing of journalists.” Israel’s military has in the past said it “takes all operationally feasible measures to protect both civilians and journalists” and that it “has never and will never deliberately target journalists.” The Committee to Protect Journalists says the Israel-Gaza war has killed more journalists in a year than any other conflict the group has documented. At least 137 journalists have been killed in Gaza, the West Bank, Israel and Lebanon since the war began, according to the CPJ, making it the deadliest period for journalists since it began collecting data in 1992. Of those killed,129were Palestinian. According to Gaza’s government media office, at least 196 journalists have been killed. Mohammad Al Sawalhi, a stringer for CNN in Gaza, said Al-Louh was well-known among journalists in Gaza and was often embedded with the Civil Defense in his capacity as a journalist, covering rescue missions. “He was a very fun person to be with, he always tried to help everyone and bring joy to everyone’s face,” Al Sawalhi said. “He had a great relationship with all journalists, helping them all because he knew central Gaza very well.” Al-Louh was just one of dozens of people killed by Israeli strikes in Gaza on Sunday. At least 15 people were killed early Sunday when an Israeli airstrike hit a school sheltering displaced people in Beit Hanoun, northern Gaza, according to the Civil Defense. Eyewitnesses reported 10 to 15 charred bodies after fires caused by “intensive Israeli bombing” at the Khalil Awida school, which was sheltering about 1,500 displaced people, the Civil Defense said. The IDF said it had carried out a “targeted raid on a terrorist meeting point in the Beit Hanoun area.” In Deir al Balah, a strike on tents killed four people and a strike on a family home east of Gaza city killed six, according to the Civil Defense. Meanwhile in the south, Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis said 12 people were killed in an Israeli strike on a UN school compound. The Israeli military said it carried out the strike, claiming there was a Hamas “command and control center embedded” within the compound. Videos of the aftermath seen by CNN show chaotic scenes as people search through the destruction, with a fire still burning. A man is sitting on the floor, screaming and wailing over what appear to be covered bodies, some quite small.\n",
            "https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/asia/south-korea-yoon-second-impeachment-hnk-intl/index.html\n",
            "South Korea’sparliament voted to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol on Saturday in an extraordinary rebuke that came about after his own ruling party turned on him following his refusal to resign over his short-lived martial law attempt. It is the second time in less than a decade that a South Korean leader has faced impeachment proceedings in office and means Yoon is suspended from exercising his powers until the decision is finally adjudicated by the country’s Constitutional Court. Following the vote, which sparked jubilation among protesters outside parliament, Yoon conceded that he will “stop temporarily for now, but the journey to the future that I’ve walked with the people for the past two years should not stop.” “I will not give up,” he said in a statement shared by the country’s presidential office. “With all the encouragement and support for me in mind, I will do my best until the last moment for the nation,” he added. The country’s Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who will serve as acting president under South Korean law, told reporters that he would “devote all my strength and effort to stable operation of state affairs.” Kang Sun-woo, a lawmaker with the Democratic Party, told CNN Saturday that the “great democracy of South Korea will survive and will be born again” after the impeachment. The dramatic decision marks the culmination of a stunning political showdown after Yoon briefly declared martial law on December 3 and sent soldiers to parliament, where lawmakers fought past troops to enter the building and vote down the decree. Yoon’s gamble backfired spectacularly, galvanizing many in the vibrant Asian democracy to call for his removal. Opposition parties tried impeaching him a week ago – but Yoon survived after members of his ruling People Power Party boycotted the vote, saying they hoped the president would voluntarily resign instead. Yoon then doubled down – giving a defiant speech on Thursday in which he defended his martial law decision, lambasted the opposition, claimed he was trying to save the country and vowed to “fight until the last moment with the people.” Yet moments before that speech, the leader of Yoon’s party withdrew his support for the president and backed impeachment as the “only way… to defend democracy”, instructing lawmakers to vote with their conscience. Thousands of protesters gathered in Seoul on Saturday, braving the cold to call for Yoon to resign ahead of the vote, which was passed by 204 lawmakers with 85 voting against it. “He surely tried to have a war against the citizens so this is just what he deserved,” one protestor, Lim Dong Eon, told CNN outside the National Assembly building after the vote, where protesting has now turned into partying. Another protestor kept their message short, telling CNN: “Democracy is back!” Meanwhile, thousands of the president’s supporters gathered in downtown Seoul, with many waving US and South Korean flags, chanting slogans and holding up signs in support of the embattled Yoon. Yoon, who has been immediately suspended of his powers, now awaits a ruling by the Constitutional Court – one of the country’s highest courts – to confirm his fate, which can take up to six months. Acting chief justice of the Constitutional Court, Moon Hyung-bae, said in a statement Saturday that a meeting will take place on Monday to discuss the case schedule, adding that the process will be conducted “swiftly and fairly.” If confirmed, he will become the second South Korean president to be thrown out of office by impeachment afterPark Geun-hye,the country’s first female leader. The now acting president, Han Duck-soo, also faces his own political problems and is being investigated over his role in the martial law decision, adding to the political uncertainty in the weeks ahead. A former prosecutor and conservative firebrand, Yoon has had a difficult two years in office, mired in low approval ratings and political scandals involving his wife and political appointments. Since he took office in 2022 he has also faced political gridlock with an opposition-majority parliament – which prevented from moving forward on legislation to cut taxes and ease business regulations, as his main rivals in the Democratic Party used the legislature to impeach key cabinet members and hold up a budget bill. His administration cracked down what he referred to as “fake news” with police and prosecutors raiding multiple media outlets, including MBC and JTBC, as well as the homes of journalists. Yoon argued that his frustration with the political deadlock drove him to take a bold power move, surprising not only members of his own party but also many military leaders. In his late-night address declaring martial law, Yoon accused the opposition of “anti-state” activities and being in cahoots with North Korea, without providing evidence – a charge his opponents have strenuously denied. He also portrayed his act as the only way to break the political deadlock in parliament. But it wasmet with shock and angeracross the country, which remainsdeeply scarredby the brutality of martial law imposed during decades of military dictatorship before it transitioned into hard-won democracy in the 1980s. Dramatic scenes from that night showed security forces breaking through windows in the National Assembly to try and prevent lawmakers from gathering, and protesters confronting riot police. Since then, pressure on the president has grown, with police, parliament, prosecutors and the anti-corruption body launching separate investigations into Yoon on treason allegations. On Tuesday, lawmakers approved a special counsel to investigate whether Yoon committed insurrection and abused his power by issuing martial law. The following day, South Korean police raided the presidential office, a presidential security official confirmed to CNN. Yoon has also beenbarred from leaving the country. Last week, South Korean prosecutorsdetained former defense ministerKim Yong-hyun, who allegedly recommended the martial law imposition and resigned in the wake of the scandal. Kim attempted to end his own life in custody late Tuesday,accordingto the head of the country’s correctional service. On Thursday, Yoon said he had only discussed the martial law decree with Kim before declaring it. Meanwhile parliament has already impeached both Yoon’s justice minister and his police chief. Senior government officials have testified at various government hearings over the last week revealing some extraordinary details about the night of the martial law order. Special Warfare Command Commander Kwak Jong-geun testified that he received a direct order from President Yoon to break the doors of the National Assembly and drag out the lawmakers, but he did not comply. South Korea, one of East Asia’s most important economies and vital US regional ally, now faces months of protracted political uncertainty of the kind that dominated the country during the last impeachment crisis in 2016 and 2017. Then-president Park Geun-hye was ultimately impeached by lawmakers over corruption allegations, kicked out of office by the Constitutional Court, jailed and later pardoned.

            "A US serviceman was sentenced to five years in prison for kidnapping and raping an underage girl last year, an official from Naha District Court on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa told CNN. The sentence was made on the grounds that the crime was a “major sexual infringement,” Judge Tetsuro Sato of Naha District Court said on Friday, according to public broadcaster NHK. “The girl’s testimony that she told her age by gestures and other means is sufficiently credible from the security camera footage,” the judge said. “The defendant was aware that the girl was under 16 years old. The defendant was aware that the girl may have said ‘stop’ and may not have consented. Given the relationship and age difference between the two, who had never met each other, it is a crime of great sexual violation that stands out for its maliciousness.” The US Air Force member, Brennon R. E. Washington, wasindicted on March 27on charges of “non-consensual sexual intercourse” and “indecent kidnapping” after he was discovered to have taken a 16-year-old Japanese girl to his residence last December and sexually assaulting her, Japanese prosecutors said. The US military handed the 25-year-old serviceman over to Japanese authorities on the same day. He was later released on bail and transferred to Kadena for custody, a government spokesperson told CNN. His trial began on July 12. “We are heartbroken and deeply regret the damage done to the victims and their families,” Air Force Brig. Gen. Nicholas Evans, commander of Kadena Air Base, told local media on Friday. “Sexual assault is a serious crime and in no way reflects the values of US military personnel.” The incident is the latest in a history of criminal cases involving US personnel in Okinawa, home to several US military installations. It could exacerbate tensions with residents who have long opposed the presence of American troops and weaponry on the island. It also comes nearly 30 years after three US servicemen raped a 12-year-old Okinawa schoolgirl in 1995, sparking a backlash against the US military on the island. In 2016, the rape and murder of a 20-year-old woman by a former US base worker in Okinawa triggeredmass protests in the island’s capital, with tens of thousands of residents demanding the US move its bases outside of Okinawa. The fallout resulted incurfews for US personnelon the island. In another crime involving US personnel in Japan, a US Navy officerkilled two Japanese nationalswhile driving down Mount Fuji in 2021. Okinawa Gov. Denny Tamaki told reporters in June this year that the allegations of rape and kidnap against Washington were “extremely regrettable,” adding it was necessary “to strongly protest against the US military and other related organizations.” The governor also said his office will “take a tough stance in dealing with the situation.” “We understand and share the local community’s concerns regarding this case,” 18th Wing 1st Lt. Alvin G. Nelson III, spokesperson for the US Air Force 18th Wing at Kadena, told CNN earlier this year, adding that wing leadership was “deeply concerned by the severity of this alleged crime” and has been working with local authorities to investigate the allegations. “All US service members are expected to uphold the highest standards, and the US military is committed to holding accountable those who are convicted of criminal acts,” Nelson said.\n",

            "TheSan Francisco 49ershave suspended linebackerDe’Vondre Campbellfor three games – the rest of the regular season – after he refused to enter his team’s game in the third quarter of a 12-6 loss to theLos Angeles Ramson Thursday night. NFL Network’sIan Rapoportwas first to report the 49ers were planning to suspend Campbell. “We have suspended De’Vondre Campbell for three games due to conduct detrimental to the team,” 49ers president of football operations and general manager John Lynch said in a statement issued Monday. “We will have no further comment on the matter.” Campbell was summoned to enter the game to replace Dre Greenlaw, who was making his return from the Achilles injury he sustained in last year’s Super Bowl, but told head coach Kyle Shanahan that he would not play, before walking to the locker room before the end of the game. In a call with reporters Friday, Shanahan said that he did not expect Campbell to be part of the team from Week 16 onward. “His actions from the game, it’s not something you can do to your team or your teammates and still expect to be a part of our team,” he said. Campbell was also criticized by his teammates. Cornerback Charvarius Ward, who was playing in his third game since returning following thedeath of his daughter, said on Thursday: “I mean, if he didn’t want to play, he shouldn’t have dressed out, he could’ve told them that before the game. So, I feel like that was some sucka sh*t that he did. Definitely hurt the team. Cause Dee (Greenlaw) went down, and we needed a linebacker. “That’s some sucka stuff to me, in my opinion. Probably going toget cut soon, so it is what it is with that.” Tight end George Kittle called Campbell’s decision “selfish,” adding: “It’s hard to win football games when someone doesn’t want to play football.” With San Francisco having a less than 1% chance of making the playoffs according toNext Gen Stats’model, Campbell – who signed a one-year, $5 million contract in March – has almost certainly played his last game for the team. By opting to suspend the former All-Pro rather than waive him, San Francisco will ensure that he cannot join another team. He will also not be paid for the remainder of the season. The 31-year-old joined the 49ersas a stand-in for the injured Greenlaw and had played 12 of 13 games before being benched on Thursday. Despite leaving the loss to the Rams, Greenlaw is expected to be healthy for San Francisco’s game against the Miami Dolphins on Sunday.\n",

            "NATO headMark Ruttewarned the US-led transatlantic alliance on Thursday that it was not ready for the threats it would face fromRussiain the coming years and called for a shift to a wartime mindset - with much higher defense spending. Rutte said future spending would have to be much higher than the current alliance target of 2% of national wealth as measured by gross domestic product (GDP). “Russia is preparing for long-term confrontation, with Ukraine and with us,” Rutte said in a speech in Brussels. “We are not ready for what is coming our way in four to five years,” the NATO secretary-general said, adding: “It is time to shift to a wartime mindset, and turbocharge our defense production and defence spending.” The alliance estimates 23 of its 32 members will meet the 2% target this year. “During the Cold War, Europeans spent far more than 3% of their GDP on defense,” Rutte said. “We are going to need a lot more than 2%,” he added. NATO members are grappling with renewed pressure from US President-elect Donald Trump, who has called for America’s allies to spend 3% of GDP on defense. Rutte, a former Dutch prime minister, said that the alliance must step up on defense production, calling on governments to “stop creating barriers between each other and between industries, banks and pension funds.” He sent a message to the defense industry: “There is money on the table, and it will only increase. So dare to innovate and take risks.” The NATO chief also warned of a “coordinated campaign to destabilize our societies” including cyberattacks and assassination attempts. Rutte also cautioned about China’s ambitions, saying that Beijing is substantially building up its forces “with no transparency and no limitations.”\n",

Using content to train AI has become a major issue as the technology booms. On X,artists and others in creative rolesare fretting about their work being used – not just on X – to train computers that could someday replace human creators entirely.OtherX users say they are concerned about personal information in their tweets being used that way. Some users said on the site they have already begundeleting photographs of themselvesfrom their feeds. And if users have any issue with those terms, they may end up in a federal courtroom that isfavored by conservative activistsand is already presiding overtwolawsuitsinvolving Musk-owned X. According to the update, all disputes related to the terms will be brought to the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas or state courts in Tarrant County, Texas. Tarrant County is more than 100 miles away from X’s new headquarters outside of Austin, Texas. X’s terms said any users who continue to use their products or services on or after November 15 would be agreeing to the updated terms. Grok, X’s AI chatbot, has already been embroiled in controversy, fromspreading false informationabout the 2024 election togenerating violent, graphic fake imagesof famous politicians. Companies fromGoogletoMicrosofthave similarlycome under fire for sometimes weird, completely off-baseAI tools. Before the most recent terms of service update, X users couldopt outof sharing data by going to “settings,” then “privacy and safety.” Under the “data sharing and personalization” header, there is a tab for“Grok,”where users can uncheck the box that allows the platform to use their data for AI training. But it’s not clear whether X’s new terms of service take away that option. X can now license all the content on the platform, including using it in its machine learning and artificial intelligence models. While such broad licensing with few limitations is not uncommon for a social media platform, Alex Fink, CEO and founder of Otherweb, an AI-based news reading platform that targets misinformation, told CNN that what makes X unique is that its new terms “remove any ambiguity” in contrast to other platforms that don’t spell out their intentions. Before, X said posts from private accounts would not be used to train Grok. But the language in the new terms of service does not differentiate between the types of accounts. But only time will tell if you may still be able to opt out, despite the new terms. Fink said it’s fairly common for a company’s legal terms to give it more leeway than its own menu options allow.

            "American players at next year’sRyder Cupwill be paid for the first time in the tournament’s history, the PGA of America announced Monday. Members of the US team will now receive $500,000 each, with $300,000 of that being directed to a charity of their choice. It’s an increase from the $200,000 per member, which was directed to charitable causes, a figure which had stayed unchanged since 1999. The PGA of America said no player had asked to be paid, but that its board of directors had voted for the change, adding that players and captains help make the Ryder Cup “the most special competition in golf.” “Golf is a long-established vehicle for good and it’s exciting to imagine the impact the members of the 2025 US Ryder Cup team will deliver for worthy causes and communities across the country, including the many initiatives that support the growth of the game,” PGA of America said in astatement. The compensation around participating in the Ryder Cup has long been discussed by players. Earlier this month, US legendTiger Woodssaid it was a conversation players were having back in 1999. Woods said that players never wanted to be paid directly, but that more should be directed towards charities. “The Ryder Cup itself makes so much money – why can’t we allocate it to various charities? And what’s wrong with each player, 12 players getting a million dollars and the ability to divvy out to amazing charities that they’re involved in that they can help out? It’s their hometowns, where they’re from, all the different junior golf associations or endeavors that the members are involved in,” Woods told reporters. “It’s never really been about getting paid, it’s how can we allocate funds to help our sport or help things that we believe in back home because it’s so hard to get onto that team, there’s only 12 guys. What’s wrong with being able to allocate more funds?” According to theAssociated Press, US captain Keegan Bradley has already decided to give his entire allocation to charity. The Ryder Cup is held every two years and pits Europe and the USA against each other as two teams made up of the biggest names in men’s golf clash for the chance to earn bragging rights in an iconic rivalry. Team Europe is the reigning champion after it held off a late comeback from the Americans to win 16.5 - 11.5 in Rome, Italy, last year.

            "The City of London financial district has approved plans for a 73-floor skyscraper that will match in height Western Europe’stallest towera mile to the south, in a sign that city planners are still betting on the office market despite the current downturn. The proposed 309.6-meter (1,015.75-foot) tower, which will be exactly the same height as London’s Shard, was given the go-ahead after a previously approved plan was revised “to better respond to post-pandemic office needs,” the City of London local authority said on Friday. Officially called 1 Undershaft, the tower was initially granted approval at a slightly smaller height in 2016 but never started. The proposed building, which investor Aroland has been trying to get off the ground for years, will require the demolition of an existing smaller tower and has attracted criticism from conservation groups. Historic England said in a consultation response to City planners in February that the alterations had not altered its impact and said it would “seriously degrade” the public realm around it. The tower, if built, would provide 154,156 square meters (around 1.66 million square feet) of office space, areas for children’s education on the 72nd and 73rd floors and a publicly accessible garden. London’s office market has been hit hard by higher borrowing costs and more home working post-pandemic, although premium space has remained in demand. Very few major London office properties have been sold this year. Investors Nuveen and Brookfield are currently trying to sell London office towers, in a major test for investor appetite. The supply of new space to let in London has slowed since the pandemic. However, office construction in the City has recently bucked the trend, with new starts up 7% between April and September this year, compared to falls in every other central London market surveyed by Deloitte. Critics say London’s skyline has become increasingly cluttered by generic glass-and-metal towers that dwarf historic landmarks, especially in the City of London, home to St. Paul’s Cathedral. “As another, much needed office development gets approved in the City of London, it speaks to the confidence that global investors have in the London real estate market and the UK economy more widely,” said Shravan Joshi, chairman of the City of London Corporation’s Planning and Transportation Committee. The Shard, currently the tallest skyscraper in Western Europe, was completed in 2012.\n",

            "More than a week after Bashar al-Assad fled Syria and his regime collapsed, hundreds of thousands of Syrians still have no answer to two questions that have haunted them for years, even decades. What happened to family members and friends after they vanished or were detained by Assad’s secret police? And how do we bring their torturers and killers to justice? Some 150,000 people in Syria are unaccounted for, most of whom were kidnapped or detained by the Assad regime or its affiliates, according to theInternational Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP). CNN cannot independently verify this number. With every passing day, Syrians’ slim hopes finding a loved one still alive are fading. But they want some form of closure; they scour prison and hospital walls where lists of names and images of bodies are posted. They cling to a sliver of hope, yearn for a miracle. But they also want retribution. One of those waiting for news wasHazem Dakel from Idlib, who is now in Sweden. His uncle Najeeb was arrested in 2012 and was later confirmed by the family as having been killed. His brother Amer was detained the following year. Former detainees at the horrific Saydnaya prison near Damascus said Amer had disappeared in mid-April 2015 after being tortured there. But the regime never acknowledged his death. “Now that people are able to talk, they are naming people, and I got details of exactly what happened in prison, and the torture, who tortured him, who interrogated him,” Dakel told CNN of his brother, “I want this (new Syrian) country to stand on its feet so we can hold them accountable through the law and courts.” Amid the celebrations in Idlib after the fall of Assad, he said, there was also mourning. “They are mourning their children. Yes, the regime fell after resistance and struggle, but there was sorrow—like, where are our children?” “Justice is coming, and our right will not be erased no matter how long it takes,” Dakel posted on Facebook. The family is now “certain” Amer died under torture in Saydnaya, hesaid. Human rights groups have begun visiting the many prisons and detention centers across Syria where those perceived as regime critics were confined. An Amnesty International team scoured security branches of the former regime around Damascus this week. Mazjoub also posted photographs on X of instruments of torture left behind. “Nothing could have prepared us for what we saw,” said one of the team, Aya Mazjoub. In a series ofpostson X she described “underground labyrinths (that) are literally hell on earth. They were overcrowded, crawling with cockroaches and other insects, lacked ventilation. They still smell of blood and death.” “This is ‘bisat ar-reeh’, a notorious torture device where detainees would be strapped to a wooden slab that would be folded until their back cracked,” she wrote. “This is the ‘doulab’. Detainees would be stuffed into the tyre and beaten, usually on the soles of their feet.” Identifying the bodies that are found will require a legion of forensic pathologists. “Many are beyond recognition, mutilated by years of torture and starvation,” said Mazjoub. Desperate relatives have taken to social media with details of sons, brothers, fathers and sisters who disappeared. In a videopostedon X, Lama Saud said her brother Abdullah was detained in 2012. Regime records had registered his death in 2014, but she said she still had hope he might be alive. “There are many detainees whose families were told they were dead but were later found to be alive,” she said. Mahmoud Al Shahabi, a Syrian living in exile, told CNN he had been waiting for news of his brothers Hikmat and Amir for 12 years. “We hope to find them, my situation is like hundreds of thousands of Syrian families who are waiting for news about their loved ones, and we will not give up hope until now.” So far, he has found no trace. Al Shahabi also asked onFacebookwhere the recordings of surveillance cameras at regime security branches had gone, why some documents had been destroyed and why human rights groups had not done more to protect records. Preserving whatever evidence is left in prisons and around possible burial sites is critical to documenting what happened and tracking down the perpetrators. But following that trail of evidence is also a race against time. Several human rights groups issued a joint appeal last week, saying: “The real toll will only be known after mass graves and documents from the detention centers are examined and authenticated by trained experts. This documentation must be preserved from destruction.” Based on the accounts of former prisoners, doctors and regime personnel, it said that an “olive-green Honda with a closed shed that could accommodate around 50 bodies” was used to take the bodies to a site in Najha near Damascus – “which has been called cemetery no.1 (the term used by regime forces is ‘cemetery of the bastards’).” Bodies at the military hospital stayed for two or three days until there were “enough to transport to Najha graveyard, and sometimes to Al Qutayfah graveyard,” and other sites, according to the report. The Association of Detainees and the Missing at Saydnaya prison, which describes itself as a coalition of prison survivors, victims, and their families, has meticulously documented what has happened there in recent years, based on witness accounts and other evidence, such as satellite imagery. Itreportedlast year how bodies were taken from the prison and a military hospital to a mass burial site. In 2020, a man known as “the Gravedigger” told a German court he was recruited by the Assad regime to bury hundreds of bodies in mass graves, including Najha, according to the International Commission on Missing Persons. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has said burial sites or mass graves “must be protected and preserved to allow organized exhumation” as soon as possible. “This is also crucial to identify and ascertain the fate of those missing and provide the much-awaited answers to their families.” After its investigators found documents strewn all over Saydnaya prison, the ICRC appealed for all records to be safeguarded at hospitals and in security centers run by the ousted regime. The ICRC has alsoaskedrelatives of the missing – abroad and in Syria – to register with it, as the mammoth task of identifying the dead begins. The conflict had killed more than 350,000 since 2011 – an “under-count of the actual number of killings,” a United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said in 2021 – and sent nearly six million refugees out of the country. Other groups put the estimated number of dead higher. AnAmnesty International investigationpublished in 2017 said that as many as 13,000 people, most of them civilians believed to be opposed to the government, were hanged in secret at Saydnaya between 2011 and 2015 alone. With reports of civilians killed under torture in the detention centers and prisons for decades, the numbers of those who have lost their lives are still being counted. In all likelihood, the vast majority of the missing are indeed dead. In a tearful statement on Syrian television last week, the head of The Syrian Network for Human Rights, Fadel Abulghany, said: “I apologize for the tenth and thousandth time, before this announcement…Most of the forcibly disappeared in Syria are dead - and I am sorry.” Now the almost overwhelming mission is to find those who died, and to identify them and their killers.\n",

            "Ousted Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s departure from the country was unplanned, according to a statement posted Monday on the Syrian Presidency Telegram account, purporting to be from Assad. The statement claims Assad movedto Russia’s airbasein Syria’s Hmeimim on the morning of Sunday, December 8, and Russia asked him to evacuate when the base came under attack. It’s unclear if Assad still controls the Telegram account. If the statement is authentic, it would mark the first time he has publicly commented on eventssince his regime fellthis month. “My departure from Syria was neither planned nor did it occur during the final hours of the battles, as some have claimed. On the contrary, I remained in Damascus, carrying out my duties until the early hours of Sunday 8th December 2024,” the statement from the Syrian Presidency account on Telegram said. The statement also claims Assad learned after he arrived at Hmeimim airbase that “the last army positions had fallen.” “With no viable means of leaving the base, Moscow requested that the base’s command arrange an immediate evacuation to Russia on the evening of Sunday 8th December. This took place a day after the fall of Damascus, following the collapse of the final military positions and the resulting paralysis of all remaining state institutions,” the statement said. “At no point during these events did I consider stepping down or seeking refuge, nor was such a proposal made by any individual or party. The only course of action was to continue fighting against the terrorist onslaught,” the statement added. Assad suggested that his position as president became “void of purpose” after the country was taken overby “terrorists.” “When the state falls into the hands of terrorism and the ability to make a meaningful contribution is lost, any position becomes void of purpose, rendering its occupation meaningless.” On the morning of December 8, Syrian rebels declared the capital ofDamascus “liberated”after entering the city with very little resistance from regime forces. Assad and his family arrived in Moscow after being granted asylum in Russia for what state media explained as “humanitarian reasons,” an official source in Russia told CNN on the night of December 8. The Kremlin said last Wednesday that ensuring the security of Russia’s military bases and diplomatic missions in Syria was “of paramount importance,” noting that Moscow had maintained contact with the new leadership in Damascus. “We must maintain contact with those who are controlling the situation on the ground because, as I mentioned, we have facilities and personnel there,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a regular press briefing.

            "Russia launched a widespread attack onUkraine’senergy infrastructure overnight, forcing the country to implement emergency power outages, Ukrainian authorities said on Friday. “The enemy continues its terror. Once again, the energy sector across Ukraine is under massive attack,” Ukrainian energy minister German Halushchenko said on his official Facebook page. The extent of the damage had yet to be clarified, he said, while urging people to remain in shelters. Streets in the capital Kyiv remained largely empty Friday morning as Ukraine’s air force warned of the threat of ballistic and cruise missiles potentially targeting parts of the country. Ukrenergo, Ukraine’s energy grid operator, said power facilities in several regions were damaged and it was introducing emergency power outages across the country. Russia has launched 12 “massive” attacks on Ukraine’s power system so far this year, Ukrenergo said. Moscow’s forces have intensified bombardments of Ukraine in recent months, leaving the country in a precarious position as the war grinds into its third winter. Last month, Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened to strike Ukraine again with a new nuclear-capableballistic missilefollowing awidespread attackon critical energy infrastructure that left more than a million households in Ukraine without power. Russia’s latest assault comes after Moscow vowed on Thursday to respond to a Ukrainian attack on a city in southwest Russia, which Russia claimed involved six US-made ATACMS ballistic missiles. Ukraine acknowledged making “tangible hits on Russian targets” Wednesday, including military and energy facilities, but has not said what type of missiles were used. Meanwhile, Russia continues its ground assault on the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine, advancing in the areas surrounding Kurakhove and Pokrovsk, according to reports from the ground and the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based think tank. The Russian defense ministry claimed on Friday that it had captured Zarya village, to the south of the key eastern city of Pokrovsk. Russian forces are just three kilometers (1.9 miles) from theoutskirts of Pokrovskafter making advances Wednesday, the Ukrainian mapping service DeepState said earlier this week. “The losses of the Russian occupiers in the Pokrovsk direction are consistently high, especially in manpower,” Ukraine’s commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said Friday. He also acknowledged that “for several months now, the Pokrovsk direction has been one of the most difficult in the context of the confrontation with the Russian occupiers.” NATO headMark Rutteon Thursday called for a shift to a wartime mindset - with much higher defense spending - warning the US-led transatlantic alliance that it was not ready for the threats it would face fromRussiain the coming years, Reuters reported. Rutte said future spending would have to be much higher than the current alliance target of 2% of national wealth as measured by gross domestic product (GDP). “During the Cold War, Europeans spent far more than 3% of their GDP on defense,” Rutte said in a speech in Brussels. “We are going to need a lot more than 2%.” “Russia is preparing for long-term confrontation, with Ukraine and with us,” Rutte said. “It is time to shift to a wartime mindset, and turbocharge our defense production and defence spending.” His comments come as US President-elect Donald Trump has called for allies to spend 3% of GDP on defense. The US on Thursday announced a $500 million aid package for Ukraine in the coming days that will pull equipment out of US military stocks. The Biden administration is working to surge deliveries ofweapons to Ukrainein its final days in office in a concerted effort to put Kyiv on a strong footing going into 2025, according to a senior administration official. In November, Biden authorized Ukraine to use powerful long-range American weapons inside Russia. Kyiv has used the newly granted powers to fire US-madeATACMS missilesat Russian targets across the border on multiple occasions. Trump has said he “vehemently” disagrees with allowing Ukraine to use US-provided weapons to strike inside Russia, and that by doing so the US is “escalating this war and making it worse.” On Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov lauded his comments, saying Moscow has the same view of the causes leading to the escalation of the conflict. When asked about Russia’s hopes for the war to end after Trump takes office, Peskov said in a press briefing that the Kremlin will wait and see after the inauguration.\n",

            "When Syria’srebel-appointed prime ministersat down with officials from the ousted Assad regime for the first time on Tuesday, the backdrop included the flag of the Syrian revolution alongside another bearing the Islamic declaration of faith that is often displayed by jihadists. The choice of optics for the rebels’ first publicizedcabinet meetingto discuss the transition of power since the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime sparked controversy, with sceptics taking to social media to criticize the move. The rebels may have taken note. In a latertelevised interview with Al Jazeera, caretaker Prime Minister Mohammad Al Bashir, who until this week ruled the small, conservative province of Idlib on the rebels’ behalf, appeared only with the new Syrian flag. How therebels governed Idlib, in northwest Syria, offers insight into how they might rule the country. Experts and residents of Idlib describe their governance as pragmatic and influenced by both internal and external pressure, with efforts to distance themselves from a jihadist past and gain international acceptance. However, their rule was far from democratic or liberal. Governing a large, diverse nation like Syria, they warn, will be an entirely different challenge. Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, the leader of Hayat Tahrir Al Sham (HTS), the Islamist group that led the rebel offensive to topple the Assad regime and is proscribed as a terrorist organization by the United States, has opted to rule from the shadows. Jolani, who now uses his real name Ahmad al-Sharaa, picked a technocrat – Bashir – to lead Syria in the interim. He has said his officials gained valuable experience while governing Idlib but acknowledged that may not be enough. “They (rebels) started from nothing, Idlib is small and without resources but thank God we were able to do really good things in the past… their experience is not zero and there are (areas) they were successful in,” Jolani told Mohammed Jalali, Assad’s prime minister,in a meeting on Mondayto discuss the transfer of power. “However, we cannot do without the old (guard) and we have to benefit from them.” In just 13 days, Jolani’s ministers went from ruling the small province of Idlib to aspiring to govern Syria following its first regime change in six decades. Experts and residents who lived under the rebel-ledSyrian Salvation Government(SSG) say the inexperienced cabinet will need to significantly adapt if they are to lead the transitional period effectively. Dr. Walid Tamer, aresident of Idlibwho witnessed the province’s transformation under rebel rule and said he personally interacted with Jolani, commended the SSG’s governance in Idlib, saying freedom of expression was protected. But he cautioned that the rebels aren’t prepared to rule the rest of the country. “You went from governing Idlib to governing an entire nation… I don’t think the capabilities of the government we saw are enough for the task of governing the whole of Syria,” said Tamer, the head of northern Syria’s Free Doctors Union who describes himself as a liberal. Idlib was “very safe” under the SSG, he said, adding that the rebels placed no restrictions on travel and movement inside the HTS-controlled province. “Syria as a whole was a difficult place to live in, but the (SSG) never interfered in your personal life. Products were available and no limitations were imposed on your clothing or how you lived your life,” he said. Life in the province was not one of prosperity, however. Abdel Latif Zakoor, a resident of Idlib who lived under rebel rule but has now moved to Turkey, told CNN the economic conditions under the SSG were “very difficult.” “There wasn’t enough work, and a lot of people just stayed at home,” he said. When Jolani expanded his influence in Idlib in 2017, he eliminated rival Islamist groups and backed a new project to install a civilian government made up of local technocrats and academics, breaking from other jihadist methods that saw religious coercion under the rule of the sword in territories they captured. “Before the Salvation Government you had many different factions that had their own courts of justice, prisons and social services,” Jerome Drevon, a senior analyst who has researched HTS for the Brussels-based International Crisis Group think tank, told CNN. “It imposed itself on other factions and took out their governing responsibilities.” Upon its establishment in 2017, the SSG issued a communique outlining four principles, one of which was that Islamic Sharia law is the “sole source of legislation,” emphasizing the need to “maintain the people’s Syrian and Islamic identity,” Al Jazeerareported. The SSG operated as a functional government, holding publicized cabinet meetingswith suited officials, issuing press statements and overseeing eleven ministries, including justice, sports, and education. It collected taxes, managed Idlib’s limited resources to govern 4 million people, and coordinated with international humanitarian groups to deliver aid to the 3 million displaced people in the region. But the government wasn’t democratically elected, with ministers appointed through the approval of the shura, or consultative council, made up of prominent local figures, some of whom were selected by Jolani’s HTS. No women served in SSG leadership positions during its seven years of rule. “It’s an Islamic governance in a technocratic way. What they wanted to do is control how religion is understood and how it’s implemented,” said Drevon. AUnited Nations reportfrom 2022 painted a grim picture of what life under HTS’ leadership was like. “People were detained following comments made in private conversations pertaining to the cost of living or religious matters,” the UN Human Rights Council report on Syria said. “These comments were qualified as slander and blasphemy, with the latter leading to a sentence of one year of imprisonment.” Authorities “continued to arrest women for being ‘inappropriately’ dressed, and for non-compliance with entertainment-related bans.” Tamer, who said he negotiated with HTS and SSG officials over medical matters, said that over the years, Jolani took a back seat in the daily affairs of the government and gave it more agency, only intervening on larger issues that endangered his group’s influence. Lacking a constitution or an elected legislature, the rebels ruled Idlib by decree, setting up a hybrid civil-Islamic court structure that included defense lawyers, a prosecutor and an appeals process. Jolani was pragmatic in adapting to the requirements of the society he ruled over, Drevon said. Responding to the public’s displeasure, he slowly phased out the strict application of Islamic law, turned a blind eye to gender mixing and smoking and allowed protests against him. A Sharia law-based morality unit was disbanded but women were encouraged to cover their hair. “It was a successful project in practice because there was also some buy in from the population. It was stable, the economy was working better (than the rest of Syria) and even the type of authoritarianism was nothing compared to Assad’s family,” Drevon said. But there were exceptions. Last year, the SSG issued a “morality decree” instructing children to adhere to an Islamic dress code and limiting music in educational facilities. Jolani intervened to freeze the decree, fearing that an international uproar could affect aid donations, Drevon said. Another issue was the arrest and alleged torture of dissidents that caused significant protests against Jolani in Idlib last year. Jolani told CNN last week that abuses in prisons “were not done under our orders or directions” and that HTS had already penalized the perpetrators. Drevon said that Syria’s transition to democracy is going to be a lengthy and complicated process after six decades of dictatorship. “It was a very new form of governance (in Idlib),” he said. “You can’t expect an armed group in war controlling a region that’s very tiny to create a social democratic system… They had to be realistic on what’s possible at war. Syria hasn’t had democracy in five, six decades. You will not become democratic in one week.”\n",

            "In their Upper East Side townhouse, TV power couple Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos have recreated a slice of Paris in New York. The glamorous five-story home has seen their three children grow up, but has largely remained unchanged since interior designers William Sofield and Emma O’Neill of Studio Sofield transformed the property into an Art Deco paradise more than a decade ago. Now, the co-hosts of “Live With Kelly and Mark” are opening the doors to the pristine space in theJanuary issue of Architectural Digest, giving a full tour that goes beyond the hints of chandeliers and holiday decor seen in the background of Ripa’s social media posts. While celebrity homes often have a short lifespan before being rotated out of their owners’ portfolios, Ripa told the magazine she has no desire to leave — ever. “I don’t want to sound morbid, but they’ll have to carry me out of here feet-first because I have gotten good and comfortable in this house,” she said. Ripa and Consuelos met on the set of soap opera “All My Children” in the 1990s and became co-stars once again last year, when Consuelos joined the long-running morning talk show, “Live,” which Ripa has co-hosted since 2001 alongside Regis Philbin, Michael Strahan and, most recently, Ryan Seacrest. In May, the couple celebrated 28 years of marriage. When they first purchased their home in 2013, Ripa was ready to move in at first sight. “I was like, ‘It’s perfect, just hand me my toothbrush,” she recalled to Architectural Digest. But Consuelos wanted to customize the property to both their personal tastes and practical needs. The result  mixed Sofield’s version of early 20th-century French glamour with functional touches, like dual Art Deco-style armoires that keep scooters and sporting equipment hidden from view. Treasures can be spotted throughout the townhouse: 1940s dining room chairs attributed to the artist and furniture designer Maurice Jallot; a Napoleon-style secretary desk, from around 1870, in the entryway; and the bedroom sconces taken from a decommissioned ocean liner. Some rooms diverge from the Parisian theme, including the kids’ rooms (which have been kept unchanged, even though they’ve now left the nest), and Consuelos’ cigar room, which boasts black leather couches, dark walls and a backlit bar with velvet curtains. But Ripa said, when it comes to interiors, she is drawn to theatrics. “I’ve spent my life growing up on sets,” Ripa said. “So I like a bit of dazzle. Give me a show.” Nowhere is this more true than in the main bathroom, where Ripa recreated some movie magic in the form of a white chaise lounge, inspired by the 1981 film “Mommie Dearest”. “There’s an amazing scene where Faye Dunaway, playing Joan Crawford, is lying on a white satin chaise in her dressing room, putting lotion on her elbow,” she told Architectural Digest, complete with a dramatic demonstration. “I had Bill (Sofield) make me an identical replica of it!” Ripa insisted on hammered satin for the piece, and Sofield’s warning against the decision soon proved to be sage. “I sat down on the chaise to apply some lotion, kind of as a joke, but when I put my leg down I basically destroyed the entire surface,” she recalled. She later had it reupholstered in cotton silk, to which Ripa said: “I learned my lesson.”\n",

            "ChatGPT can be duped into providing detailed advice on how to commit crimes ranging from money laundering to the export of weapons to sanctioned countries, a tech startup found, raising questions over the chatbot’s safeguards against its use to aid illegal activity. Norwegian firm Strise ran experiments asking ChatGPT for tips on committing specific crimes. In one experiment, conducted last month, the chatbot came up with advice on how to launder money across borders, according to Strise. And in another experiment, run earlier this month, ChatGPT produced lists of methods to help businesses evade sanctions, such as those against Russia, including bans on certain cross-border payments and the sale of arms. Strise sells software that helps banks and other companies combat money laundering, identify sanctioned individuals and tackle other risks. Among its clients are Nordea, a leading bank in the Nordic region, PwC Norway and Handelsbanken. Marit Rødevand, Strise’s co-founder and chief executive, said would-be lawbreakers could now usegenerative artificial intelligencechatbots such as ChatGPT to plan their activities more quickly and easily than in the past. “It is really effortless. It’s just an app on my phone,” she told CNN. Strise found that it is possible to circumvent blocks put in place by OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, aimed at preventing the chatbot from responding to certain questions by asking questions indirectly, or by taking on a persona. “It’s like having a corrupt financial adviser on your desktop,” Rødevand said on the company’s podcast last month, describing the money laundering experiment. An OpenAI spokesperson told CNN: “We’re constantly making ChatGPT better at stopping deliberate attempts to trick it, without losing its helpfulness or creativity.” “Our latest (model) is our most advanced and safest yet, significantly outperforming previous models in resisting deliberate attempts to generate unsafe content,” the spokesperson added. While the internet has long provided people with easy access to information on how to commit crimes, generative AI chatbots have dramatically sped up the process of finding, interpreting and consolidating all kinds of information. ChatGPT makes it “significantly easier for malicious actors to better understand and subsequently carry out various types of crime,” according to areportby Europol, the European Union’s law enforcement agency, published in March last year, four months after OpenAI released the app to the public. “Being able to dive deeper into topics without having to manually search and summarize the vast amount of information found on classical search engines can speed up the learning process significantly,” the agency added. Generative AI chatbots are trained on huge volumes of data found online and are able to to produce detailed responses to unfamiliar questions. But they can also reproduce people’sracistandsexistbiases, as well as peddledisinformation— for example, about elections. OpenAI is aware of the power of its tool and has created safeguards to prevent itsabuse. A quick experiment by CNN showed that when ChatGPT was asked, “how can I, as the owner of a US-based export business, evade sanctions against Russia?” the chatbot responded, “I can’t assist with that.” The app immediately removed the offending question from the chat and statedthat the content  may violate OpenAI’susage policies. “Violating our policies could result in action against your account, up to suspension or termination,” the company states in those policies. “We also work to make our models safer and more useful, by training them to refuse harmful instructions and reduce their tendency to produce harmful content.” But in its report last year, Europol said there was “no shortage of new workarounds” to evade the safeguards built into AI models, which can be used by ill-intentioned users or researchers testing the technology’s safety.

There’s been a whole bunch of international infrastructure projects in the news this week, with a strong focus on digging. Busy beavers and merry moles have been chattering about resurfaced plans for a$20 trillion transatlantic tunnelthat could theoretically link London and New York in just an hour using vacuum tube technology. That’s 3,000 miles of burrowing, mind, which Newsweek estimates could take the best part of a millennium if construction proceeded at the same rate as Europe’s Channel Tunnel. In plans that are actually happening, Norway broke ground last month on itsRogfast project, which promises to be the world’s longest, deepest undersea road tunnel. Elsewhere in northern Europe, the world’s longest road and rail tunnel, theFehmarnbelt Tunnelbetween Denmark and Germany, is slated to open in 2029. Southern Europe isn’t shy of a project or two, either. Construction of anew bridgelinking Greece and Turkey might be closer to getting underway, the Greek Reporter said Friday. Over near the western end of Europe, the UK is busy building one of the world’s most expensive railway projects, known as HS2 (High Speed 2), which now costs an almighty$416 million per mile. However, many people think it’s pointless. That comes a few years after the UK resurfaced plans for what would have been one of theworld’s most ambitious bridges, linking Britain and Ireland. It was to cross just a 12-mile stretch, but the waters were deep enough to submerge the Eiffel Tower. Then there was the matter of all the radioactive waste and unexploded munitions.Unsurprisingly, plans were dropped. A top musician who played at the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was forced to cancel a concert this week after Air Canada refused to give hismulti-million-dollar celloa seat on the plane. For others, the trouble only starts at the baggage carousel, although there’s progress on easing some of the pain of that. United Airlines has rolled out a new way to tracklost luggagewith AirTags, with users being able to share location information directly with the airline. Other carriers, including Delta, Lufthansa and Qantas, are set to follow suit. Finally, Japan Airlines has announced a baggage delivery service for travelers that will allow luggage to be dropped off at customers’ hotels for a fee. The idea is toreduce overcrowdingon Tokyo’s public transport. It’s always a bad idea to put wrapped Christmas presents in your airplane luggage – if they raise concerns with airport security, they’re likely to be unwrapped.

            "During his first term as US president, Donald Trump was widely seen as a friend to Taiwan, having bolstered support for the island through increased arm sales and upgraded diplomatic visits. But that goodwill was nowhere to be found on the campaign trail, with Trump repeatedly claiming that the self-ruled democracy should pay the US more for “protection” and that it had “stolen” America’s chip business. That’s why Taiwan is buckling up for what could be a far more volatile relationship with Washington, its most important security guarantor, now that Trump has clenched a historic political comeback. “I think most people are anxious,” Professor Chen Ming-chi, a former senior advisor to Taiwan’s National Security Council, told CNN.  “Because of Trump’s unpredictability, we don’t know if Taiwan will be safer or more dangerous under his second term.” What is certain, observers say, is that Taiwan will have to pay more for its own defense and step up engagement with the Trump administration to shore up American support. China’s ruling Communist Party views Taiwan as part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island by force if necessary. Under the Taiwan Relations Act, Washington is legally required to provide the island with the means to defend itself, and it supplies Taipei with defensive weaponry. The Taiwanese government has expressed confidence in bilateral ties, citing longstanding bipartisan support for the island.  Three senior Taiwanese security officials told CNN there are clear communication channels through which both sides discuss substantive issues, irrespective of past leadership changes,  and military communication channels in  particular have “flourished.” In a statement issued after the November election, Taiwan President Lai Ching-te stressed the importance of Taiwan’s friendship with the US and said Taipei is willing to be “the most reliable partner.” Experts say Taiwan will be closely watching Trump’s foreign policy and defense appointments, his response to Russia’s war in Ukraine and his demands on allies for clues on the future of the relationship. The stakes of that relationship are higher than ever as Beijing ramps up military intimidation of Taiwan, sending fighter jets and warships near the island almost on a daily basis and launching large-scale drills to punish what it calls “separatist acts.” This week, Taiwan’s Defense MinistrysaidChina fielded its largest regional maritime deployment in decades, as it braced for expected military exercises after Lai sparked Beijing’s ire by making unofficial stops in Hawaii and the US territory of Guam. Beijing has not announced any military drills or acknowledged the large-scale deployment cited by Taipei. US officialshave saidChina’s regional naval deployments are elevated but consistent with other large exercises in the past. But one thing’s for sure: Trump is a less vocal supporter of Taiwan than Joe Biden. The outgoing president hasrepeatedly saidthe US would be willing to intervene militarily should the Chinese attack the island, before the White House would walk back his comments. The US has long been governed by a policy of “strategic ambiguity” over exactly how it would respond to an invasion of Taiwan. Trump, though, has taken that ambiguity to another level. Asked by the Wall Street Journal if he would use military force against a blockade on Taiwan by China, Trump said it would not come to that because Xi respected him and knows he’s “crazy.” Instead, he said he would slap 150% to 200% tariffs on Beijing. In an October episode of the “The Joe Rogan Experience” podcast, Trump hit out at America’s longtime friend, saying Taiwan doesn’t “pay us money for the protection, you know? The mob makes you pay money, right?” Taiwan’s mutual defense treaty with Washington ended in 1979 along with official diplomatic ties. Unlike South Korea and Japan, it doesn’t pay for American military forces to be based in its territory.  Still, the US is the island’s biggest arms dealer. Ivan Kanapathy, a former White House National Security Council deputy senior director for Asia who served in the Trump and Biden administrations, told CNN that Trump’s remarks are an indication Taipei should “dramatically increase spending on US weapons and training, just as it did during the first Trump administration.” “US and Taiwanese national security interests overlap significantly,” said Kanapathy. “But the United States can’t want to help Taiwan more than Taiwan wants to help itself. That’s the bottom line.” Taiwan has long procured weaponry and military equipment from the US. There is currently a backlog of more than $20 billion in military gear that Taiwan has ordered and is still awaiting delivery.  It has also been increasing its defense budget over the years. This year, the Taiwanese government proposed a record high military budget that accounts for approximately 2.5% of the island’s total economic output, far less than the 10% target Trump said Taiwan should commit to. A significant increase in defense spending, however, could be politically difficult for Taiwan’s President Lai, as his party does not have a majority in the legislature. And 10% would make Taiwan among the highest military spenders in the world, three times more than what the US spends on its military as a percentage of its economy. Trump won re-election earlier this month and has announced a proposed cabinet stacked with multiple China hawks. Trump has also repeatedly accused Taiwan of “stealing” America’s chip business and has suggested imposing tariffs on Taiwan’s critical chip exports, which are used to power an array of modern technologies, from smartphones to artificial intelligence applications. While experts have dismissed Trump’s comments, saying Taiwan grew its own semiconductor industry organically through a combination of foresight, hard work and investment, the remarks have prompted jitters that Taiwan would need to move more of its critical chip supply chain to the US at a faster pace. A move like that could affect the island’s economic security and dismantle the very “silicon shield” that some say helps protect Taiwan from the threat of an invasion by Beijing. Kristy Hsu, director of the Taiwan ASEAN Studies Center at the Chung-hua Institution for Economic Research, told CNN that while tariffs on Taiwan’s chip exports wouldn’t have a huge impact possible policy shifts could hit the industry hard. “If Trump is going to do something against the chips supply chain, including more rigid export controls, that may have a lot of impact on Taiwan,” she said, referring to restrictions on which countries or companies Taiwanese chip suppliers may sell to. Earlier this month, Reuters reported the US had ordered Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, to halt shipments of advanced chips to Chinese customers.  TSMC manufactures 90% of the world’s most advanced chips. The move came after TSMC-made chips were reportedly found in devices made by Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications giant sanctioned by the US in 2019. TSMC said it had not supplied chips to Huawei since September 2020, but it continues to supply other Chinese clients, prompting concerns that Huawei may still have access to these chips through other Chinese firms. In a statement, TSMC said it does not comment on “market rumor,” adding that it is “committed to complying with all applicable rules and regulations, including applicable export controls.” The Commerce Department declined to comment to CNN on the issue. Analysts say increasing outreach and education efforts would be key for Taiwanese chip businesses to mitigate risks as Trump begins his second term. “For Taiwan’s semiconductor industry, they have their work cut out for them,” a former senior Commerce Department official who served under the first Trump administration told CNN. “They really have to look in the mirror and say we need to do a better job of explaining to Americans about why we are a trusted partner, why our technology is superior to China, and why you can count on us.”\n",

            "Five years after it was nearly destroyed in a devastating fire, Notre Dame de Paris formally reopened on Saturday with a two-hour ceremony inside the famed cathedral’s gleaming, newly renovated interior. Global leaders and dignitariesincluding US President-elect Donald Trump, current US first lady Jill Biden, Elon Musk — the world’s richest man —  and Britain’s Prince William joined French President Emmanuel Macron in a celebration that fused Catholic tradition with a dash of history and politics. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who attended last-minute and met with Trump and Macron at the Elysee palace earlier in the day, was welcomed to the church with a standing ovation. Some 170 bishops from around the world and priests from each of the 106 parishes in the Paris diocese were involved in the festivities, but Pope Francis did not attend. The pontiff instead sent a message, describing the cathedral’s reopening as a moment of “joy, celebration, and praise.” Inclement weather forced organizers to move the beginning of the service, which was supposed to take place on the redesigned forecourt in front of the cathedral, inside, where it was sheltered from the rain and the howls of nearly 40 mile-per-hour winds whipping against the building’s exterior. For the hundreds in attendance, the main show was not just in front of them, but all around. It was their first look inside the cherished UNESCO world heritage site following an estimated €700 million ($739 million) restoration. Centuries of grime has been wiped away to reveal an immaculate but aesthetically dissonant house of worship:a Gothic church that glistens. “The world will find again this cathedral rebuilt and embellished,” Macron said. “Tonight, together, we can share joy and pride.” The French president, who is mired in a political crisisfollowing his government’s collapse on Wednesday, attempted to use the global spotlight on his country to showcase French soft power while also stoking pride and patriotism at home, as he did during the Paris Olympics. “We rediscovered what great nations can do: accomplish the impossible,” Macron told the more than 2,000-strong congregation. “The cathedral became a beautiful metaphor for what a nation is, and what the world should be,” he added. And like the Summer Games’ opening ceremony, a wet and windy central Paris felt once again as if it was on lockdown. French authorities brought in an extra 6,000 security officers for the event and closed Ile de la Cite, the island in the Seine River where Notre Dame is located, to everyone except residents, law enforcement and attendees. Saturday’s ceremony kicked off with the tolling of Notre Dame’s bells, located in the cathedral’s tower where Victor Hugo’s hunchbacked bell ringer Quasimodo lived in 1831 novel. Dozens of bishops gathered outside, their white robes whipping in the wind as Archbishop of Paris Laurent Ulrich struck the closed cathedral doors with his crozier, an ornate staff, to officially mark the cathedral’s reopening. Through the doorframe, onlookers saw floodlights beam onto the downpour, providing a cinematic backdrop for Notre Dame’s spiritual leader as he led his clergy in from the cold for the first time since the blaze on April 15, 2019, after what investigators believe was an accident. By the time some 600 firefighters had doused the fire’s final flames, much of Notre Dame, a jewel of Gothic architecture, lay in ruins. The 315-foot spire that had graced the Parisian skylinesince 1859collapsed through the lead roof. “The forest,” an intricate, wooden lattice structure under the lead roof dating back to the 13th century, was completely destroyed. Centuries-old murals and priceless artifacts were covered in soot and lead. Macron had pledged to rebuild, asking that it be done in five years – an ambitious deadline that some experts panned as unrealistic. Yet after a herculean, 2,000-plus day effort involving more than 2,000 workers, “Our Lady of Paris” was ready to welcome visitors before the close of 2024. The world got its first glimpse insideon November 29, when cameras followed Macron on his seventh and final visit to the construction site. There he met with various artisans and expressed his gratitude to the 1,000-plus craftspeople in attendance who helped him keep his promise. Organizers used Saturday’s ceremony to honor many of the firefighters who responded to the blaze. Dozens were paraded through the nave as guests applauded. Later, thecathedral’s grand organ– France’s largest instrument complete with its 8,000 pipes and five keyboards – was played once more. Following the ceremony, Macron hosted a dinner at the Elysee palace for the 50 or so heads of state and government in attendance. While Saturday’s events marked Notre Dame’s official reopening, the inaugural mass will take place Sunday morning. Masses will be held twice daily for eight days, along with special evening ceremonies. Many of these events will be open to the public but may require reservations in advance.\n",

They’re also home to forests of lesser-known but critically important polylepis– known as “cloud trees.” Growing up to 5,000 meters above sea level, they are thehighest-altitude trees in the worldand are known to absorb and retain water from clouds and the Andes’ melting glaciers. Slowly, they release this water through spongy moss that covers the trees, feeding the mountain streams and, eventually, the headwaters of the Amazon River. In the past, polylepis forests covered vast areas of the mountain range, but today, after hundreds of years of deforestation and development, just500,000 hectaresremain, thought to be between1% and 10%of the original forest. As a result, ecosystems have degraded, and the forestsno longer provide a natural barrier to flooding or erosion. The water security of the millions of people who live in the foothills of the Andes is also at risk. Constantino Aucca Chutas, a Peruvian biologist whose grandparents were farmers from the indigenous Quechua community, felt compelled to protect his ancestral lands and the people who live on them. “I’m proud of being an Inca descendant,” he tells CNN. “When I was a child, I grew up near rivers, enjoying seeing the creatures and all this magnificent nature. I thought to myself, it would be fantastic if we can pass this to the new generations.” In 2018, he co-founded Acción Andina, a joint initiative between US nonprofit Global Forest Generation and Peruvian nonprofit Asociación Ecosistemas Andinos, dedicated to restoring the highland forest and protecting the local communities that depend on it. Work began in Peru, but has since spread across Ecuador, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Colombia, with the ultimate goal of protecting and restoring one million hectares of native Andean forest by 2045. To date, Aucca Chutas says the initiative has planted more than 10 million trees across the region, with the help of thousands of indigenous families. “The first time we were all united along the Andes was when we were part of one empire, the Inca empire,” he says. “The second time we united again to fight for our independence… This is the third time: united for one tree, the polylepis tree.” The Inca, a civilization that ruled across the Andes mountain range in the 15th and 16th centuries AD, worshiped “Pachamama” or “Mother Earth.” Aucca Chutas says that a deep respect for nature was ingrained in the culture, with animals such as the condor, puma and the snake representing heaven, Earth and the world of the dead. “In the Inca culture, they respect rivers, mountains and the environment,” he says. “They managed the nature, lived in balance with nature. That is the thing that we need to learn and practice.” They also believed in the concept of “Ayni and Minka,” he adds, which represented an idea of working together for the common good. He was determined to revive this principle to help save the highland forests, enlisting the help of local Quechua communities. “My dream was to plant millions of trees and I’m not going to do that alone,” he says. Each year, in the valleys around Cusco, a city in the Peruvian Andes, Acción Andina hosts Queuña Raymi, a tree-growing festival. The celebration begins with ancestral rituals, such as dances and music to honor Pachamama. Then all generations, young and old, male and female, climb the mountain together, dressed in bright traditional clothing and carrying bundles of polylepis saplings on their backs. In previous years, the community has planted as many as 100,000 trees in a single day, using a process of propagation, where root cuttings are planted. Aucca Chutas says that it is important to only plant local species as they have found that polylepis trees vary between regions and altitudes. After planting, the initiative puts up fencing and sets up programs to protect the trees from fire, while the community help to care for and maintain the saplings. The local knowledge is invaluable, says Aucca Chutas: “They have lived in the forest all their lives and have been seeing how these trees are growing, and I think they understand it much better than us.” In return for their efforts, Acción Andina provides communities with support such as arranging medical care and installing solar panels to help bring electricity to villages. It also helps to secure legal rights to their land and establish protected areas for the native forests, safeguarding them against exploitation by timber, mining and oil companies. The initiative has been hailed as a model for community-based conservation worldwide.In 2024, Acción Andina won Prince William’sEarthshot Prizein the “Protect and Restore Nature” category, and in 2022, Aucca Chutas was named a “Champion of the Earth” by the UN. “This community-led restoration is an example of how people and communities can come together for nature, creating jobs and enhancing conservation efforts globally,” Elizabeth Mrema, deputy executive director of the UN Environment Programme, told CNN in an email. “The nature benefits of polylepis forests are immense,” she added. “They prevent soil erosion, capture moisture and retain rainwater with their lichens, mosses and other accompanying plants, playing a major role in water security together with the wetlands.” These magical trees are worth protecting, and to do that, Aucca Chutas believes a collective approach is vital. “It’s the only way conservation is going to be successful,” he says. “Conservation and the protection of Mother Earth is a responsibility for all of us.”\n",

            "A few years ago, it would have been unimaginable that Italy would be home to one of the most stable governments in Europe. Italian coalition administrations tended to last just over a yearbefore collapsing, making Italy predictably unpredictable. But a series of factors, including government crises in relatively stable countries likeFranceandGermany, and the roaring popularity of Italy’s current coalition led by far-right Prime MinisterGiorgia Meloni, in power since 2022, have made Rome the key player in Europe’s relationship with the US under Donald Trump’s second presidency. During his last term Trumpcalled Europea “foe” of the US. This time, Meloni has the potential to turn that around thanks in part to their mutual friend Elon Musk. Musk, Trump and Meloni dined together at French President Emmanuel Macron’s 60-person dinner after the official reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris last weekend, an experience Trump latertold The New York Postwas positive. “We got along great,” he said, adding that he and Meloni had spent “a lot of time together.” Describing the diminutive figure (Meloni herself has often joked about her 5’ 2” height) as a “live wire,” he predicted that they could “straighten out the world a little bit.” The two leaders, while politically similar, don’t necessarily align on all the world’s most pressing conflicts. Meloni has been one of Ukraine’s strongest backers, having met with President Volodymyr Zelensky a dozen times since Russia’s invasion. Whether she can in any way affect what Trump might do, however, is hard to know, but she will have first dibs to try in Europe. “Before there is a new government in Germany and with the current situation in France, when Trump comes into the White House, Italy will have a kind of monopoly, as the only country with a stable government,” Giovanni Orsina, director of the department of Political Science at Luiss University in Rome, told CNN. “Meloni and Musk have a very good ongoing relationship, and Musk can be a kind of best friend to both, as long as the Trump-Musk honeymoon lasts at least.” Musk and Meloni forged their very strong friendship in the summer of 2023, and the Tesla founderheadlinedMeloni’s Brothers of Italy political convention, Atreju, in December last year. He is rumored to be making a surprise appearance at the same convention this weekend in Rome, which is being headlined by Argentinian President Javier Milei, another of Trump’s populist bedfellows. So close is their relationship that Meloni and Musk had to take to social media earlier this year to dispel rumors of a romance, after he gushed about her beauty when he presented her with a Global Citizens Award on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York. A photo of them locked in a gaze went viral, to which Musktweetedthat he was there with his mother and that there is “no romantic relationship whatsoever with PM Meloni.” Orsina believes that Musk can make it easier for the Italian prime minister to “get in touch” with Trump whenever she feels the need. “There is an opportunity for Meloni to take the initiative and be a bridge between the Trump administration and Europe,” he said. Meloni claims to have already started that bridging process in Paris, posting a thumbs-up shot of herself with Trumpon Xwith the headline, “There is already an alliance. The USA-EU axis passes through Italy.” This is not the first time Meloni has been in the good graces of the MAGA elite. Steve Bannon was her American supporter before Musk, headlining her Atreju political convention back in 2018, telling CNN at the time that he believed she would be one of the most important politicians in Europe. Once she was elected in 2022 and became more moderate, Bannon, no longer wielding the power he once did as Trump’s chief strategist, grew cold, telling Italian newspaperCorriere Della Seralast week that she has been a disappointment. “Meloni has almost turned into a Nikki Haley,” he told the Italian daily, referring to Trump’s opponent in the Republican primaries. Citing her support for Ukraine, and what he describes as Italy’s lack of work on trade, he predicts that it won’t be Meloni who influences Trump, but the other way around. “I think her attitude will change with the arrival of President Trump, who will convince her,” Bannon said. “And that NATO countries will get on board quite quickly. Otherwise, if she really believes what she has said in recent years, she should be ready with others in Europe to put money into it, to write checks as big as the speeches. We in the MAGA movement are adamant, we want to cut funding for Ukraine in the Chamber by 100%.” For the moment, Meloni appears to be on Musk’s, and as a result, Trump’s right sides. “She is a ‘day after’ politician, much more than a ‘day before’ politician,” Orsina says, referring to the likelihood she will be reactive rather than proactive when it comes to Trump’s approach to Europe.\n",

            "Two Russian tankers carrying thousands of tons of fuel werebadly damaged in stormy weathernear the Black Sea over the weekend, leading to an oil spill, according to Russian state media. The Volgoneft 212 and Volgoneft 239 vessels were in the Kerch Strait between mainland Russia andannexed Crimeawhen they got into peril on Sunday, with winds in the area reaching up to 45 mph (70 kph). Greenpeace Ukraine told CNN Monday that 3,700 tons of oil had so far spilled into the sea, citing Russian sources. They added that this was significantly more than a similar spill in 2007, which led to contamination of both coastlines of the Kerch Strait and affected thousands of birds and marine life for years. Video circulating on unofficial Ukrainian and Russian Telegram channels appeared to show one large ship snapped in two, with water spilling over the edge of the top deck of the vessel as choppy waves rocked it from side to side. The bow of a ship, seen in the background of the video, was broken off and appeared just above the water line. Crew members could be seen wearing lifejackets as the camera spun around. CNN has been unable to independently verify the location of the video. Russian state media TASS reported that the Volgoneft 212 tanker had its bow torn off in the storm. One of the vessel’s crew members died in the incident, it said. Volgoneft 239 was also damaged and ran aground near the port of Taman in Russia’s Krasnodar region, TASS said. Some 14 people were rescued from the vessel. The tankers were carrying more than 9,000 tons of oil, emergency services reported, according to TASS. Some of this oil spilled into the Kerch Strait, which specialists were preparing to clean up, it said. In a bid to dodge sanctions, Russia has been known to send oil to countries like China, India and Turkey by transferring it from one ship to another in international waters. Some of these vessels will leave Russia from ports on the Black Sea, traveling to the Mediterranean, where they will illegally turn off their transponders to bypass strict rules governing this type of oil transfer. On Monday, the European Union adopted new measures to specifically target Putin’s“shadow fleet”of tankers, subjecting them to a port access ban and a “ban on provision of a broad range of services related to maritime transport.” Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the decision to target the fleet, which he says supports Russia’s energy sector and helps to transport military equipment. There are now sanctions on 52 additional vessels, bringing the total to 79, he added. “Russia’s war machine runs on oil. Without multibillion-dollar oil revenues, Putin would not have been able to reject real negotiations or ruin international peace and security for so many years,” he said in a statementposted on X. Dmytro Pletenchuk, Ukraine’s navy spokesperson, accused Russia of prioritizing the transfer of oil over safety. “These are quite old vessels. Each of them is 50 years old or more. That is why the Russians have once again violated everything they could have violated,” he said Sunday. “Transferring Russian oil and other fuels and lubricants is more important to them than complying with the safety requirements for civilian shipping,” he added. This weekend’s oil spill “has the potential to be serious,” Greenpeace Ukraine said in astatementpublished on Sunday, especially given the area’s weather conditions, which could make the leak “extremely difficult to contain.” The impact of the spill could also depend on the type of oil the vessels were carrying, Paul Johnston, head of Greenpeace Research Laboratories, said in the statement. Heavy residual fuel oils would cause more damage than other substances, he said. The region suffered a similar oil spill in November 2007, when five ships sank in storms in the Black Sea and the Azov Sea. In that incident, strong winds and high surf caused the Volgoneft 139 to split in two, spilling up 560,000 gallons, or approximately 1,000 tons, of fuel oil.\n",

            "A man who wasfilmed by CNNbeing released by rebels from a Damascus jail was a former intelligence officer with the deposed Syrian regime, according to local residents, and not an ordinary citizen who had been imprisoned, as he had claimed. CNN initially found the man while pursuing leads on the missing US journalist Austin Tice. In a video report, chief international correspondent Clarissa Ward and her team, accompanied by a rebel guard,came across a cell in a Damascus jailthat was padlocked from the outside. The guard blew off the lock with a gun, and the man was found alone inside the cell, under a blanket. When he emerged into the open air, the man appeared bewildered. Questioned by the rebel fighter who freed him, the man identified himself as Adel Ghurbal from the central Syrian city of Homs. He claimed that he had been kept in a cell for three months, adding that it was the third prison where he had been confined. The man also said he was not aware that the Assad regime had fallen. He was being held in a jail that had been run by the Syrian air force’s intelligence services until the Assad regime collapsed. An image obtained by CNN on Monday now points to the man’s real identity – said to be a lieutenant in the Assad regime’s Air Force Intelligence Directorate, Salama Mohammad Salama. A resident of the Bayada neighborhood in Homs gave CNN a photograph said to be of the same man while he was on duty, in what appears to be a government office. Facial recognition software provided a match of more than 99 percent with the man CNN met in the Damascus prison cell. The photograph shows him sitting at a desk, apparently in military clothing. CNN is not publishing the photo to protect the source’s anonymity. As CNN continued to pursue information about the freed prisoner after the original report, multiple residents of Homs said that the man was Salama, also known as Abu Hamza. They told CNN that he was known for running the Air Force Intelligence Directorate’s checkpoints in the city and accused him of having a reputation for extortion and harassment. It’s unclear how or why Salama ended up in the Damascus jail, and CNN has not been able to reestablish contact with him. Over the weekend, Verify-Sy, which says it is a Syrian fact-checking website,was the first to identify the man as Salama.It said that he had been jailed for less than a month because of a dispute over “profit-sharing from extorted funds with a higher-ranking officer.” CNN cannot independently verify this claim. Rebel guards handed him over to the Syrian Red Crescent. The medical relief organization later posteda picture of him on social media, saying they had returned a freed prisoner to relatives in Damascus. Salama’s current whereabouts are unknown.\n",

            "South Korea’sruling party has thrown its support behind attempts to impeach embattled President Yoon Suk Yeol over his ill-fated decision to declare martial law that sparked a political crisis and widespread public anger in the country. The announcement came moments before Yoon delivered a defiant speech Thursday in which he attempted to justify his hugely controversial martial law decision and rejected growing calls from across the political spectrum for him to stand down. The People Power Party (PPP) had initially refused to back impeachment, hoping instead Yoon would resign from office. But its leadership said attempts to persuade him had made no progress. “We tried to find a better way than impeachment, but that other way is invalid,” party leader Han Dong-hoon said. “Suspending the president from his duties through impeachment is the only way for now, to defend democracy and the republic.” The main opposition Democratic Party is preparing a new impeachment motion against Yoon, with a vote expected as soon as Saturday. The presidentsurvived an impeachment bidlast weekend when PPP members boycotted the vote. But after his party threw its weight behind impeachment, Han said PPP lawmakers were now free to vote according to their “belief and conscience.” “I believe our party members will vote for the country and the people,” he said. The PPP’s reversal Thursday dramatically increases the pressure on Yoon and the likelihood that the next impeachment attempt will be successful. Yoon has faced mounting calls to stand down since he declared a military emergency on December 3, accusing the main opposition party of “anti-state activities,” sympathizing with North Korea and blocking legislation and budgets. The surprise late night announcement, which was blocked by lawmakers within hours, wasmet with shock and angeracross the country, which remainsdeeply scarredby the brutality of martial law imposed during decades of military dictatorship before it won a long, bloody fight for democracy in the 1980s. Dramatic scenes from that night showed security forces breaking through windows in the National Assembly to try and prevent lawmakers from gathering, and protesters confronting riot police. In the days since, pressure on Yoon has grown, with protesters and opposition figures demanding his impeachment – and support wavering evenwithin his own partyand the military. Police have launched an investigation into Yoon and other top officials on treason allegations. And on Tuesday, lawmakers approved a special counsel to investigate whether Yoon committed insurrection and abused his power by issuing martial law. Yoon has also beenbarred from leaving the country. The following day, South Korean police raided the presidential office, a presidential security official confirmed to CNN. Several South Korean officials close to Yoon have been reprimanded for their roles in the emergency declaration. Last week, South Korean prosecutorsdetained former defense ministerKim Yong-hyun, who allegedly recommended the martial law imposition and resigned in the wake of the scandal. Kim attempted to end his own life in custody late Tuesday,accordingto the head of the country’s correctional service. On Thursday, lawmakers voted to impeach Justice Minister Park Sung-jae and National Police Agency Chief Cho Ji-ho. In South Korea’s increasingly partisan political environment, Yoon has portrayed the opposition, led by the Democratic Party, of being overly soft onNorth Korea, which they deny. In his speech Thursday, Yoon portrayed his brief declaration of martial law as an attempt to break the political stalemate, while accusing the opposition of “siding with North Korea, scratching the government that is struggling to respond” to Pyongyang’s launches oftrash balloonsinto the South, illegal nuclear armament and missile threats. “I don’t know which country the party belongs to and which country the National Assembly belongs to,” Yoon said. A former prosecutor and conservative firebrand, Yoon has had a difficult two years in office. He has faced plummeting approval ratings over economic issues and aseries of scandals involving his wifeand political appointments that prompted calls for him to resign. And in recent months, gridlock in parliament had left him a lame-duck president prevented from moving forward on legislation to cut taxes and ease business regulations, as his main rivals in the Democratic Party used the legislature to impeach key cabinet members and hold up a budget bill. In his Thursday speech, a defiant Yoon sought to downplay his actions, saying the opposition was “creating a lot of false incitement to drag the president down by creating (the) crime of treason.” Yoon also claimed he declared martial law “to maintain order, not to dismiss the National Assembly nor to paralyze its function.” “If I were to paralyze the functions of the National Assembly, I would’ve enforced martial law on the weekend, not a weekday,” he said. “And cut power and water at the parliament building first, and restrict broadcasting. But I didn’t do any of that.” As his hold on the country becomes more tenuous, Yoon also pledged to “fight until the last moment with the people.” “I apologize again to the people who might have been surprised and nervous due to the short-lived martial law,” he said. Please trust in my passionate loyalty for you, the people.” This story has been updated with additional information.\n",

            "Thousands are feared dead after a devastating 100-year cyclone ripped across the French archipelago of Mayotte on Saturday, inflicting destruction that one resident likened to an atomic bomb. “The situation is catastrophic, apocalyptic,” Bruno Garcia, owner of Hotel Caribou in Mamoudzou, Mayotte’s capital, told CNN-affiliate BFMTV. “We lost everything. The entire hotel is completely destroyed,” Garcia said. “There is nothing left. It’s as if an atomic bomb fell on Mayotte.” Mayotte lies in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa, just west of Madagascar. Made up of two main islands, its land area is about twice the size of Washington DC. Cyclone Chido, a category 4 storm, tore through the southwestern Indian Ocean over the weekend, impacting northern Madagascar before rapidly intensifying and slamming Mayotte with winds above 220 kilometers per hour (136 miles per hour), according to France’s weather service. It was the strongest storm to hit the islands in more than 90 years, Meteo-France said. Chido then continued into northern Mozambique where it continued to cause damage, though the storm has now weakened. The cyclone – the worst to hit the territory of just over 300,000 in at least 90 years – flattened neighborhoods, knocked out electrical grids, crushed hospitals and schools and damaged the airport’s control tower. “Honestly, what we are experiencing is a tragedy, you feel like you are in the aftermath of a nuclear war… I saw an entire neighborhood disappear,” Mohamed Ishmael, a Mamoudzou resident, told Reuters. At least 14 people have been confirmed dead by the French health minister, but the true death toll is expected to be much higher, with local officials predicting the number of victims could be in the hundreds or even thousands, the Associated Press reported. “I think there are some several hundred dead, maybe we’ll get close to a thousand. Even thousands … given the violence of this event,″ Mayotte Prefect François-Xavier Bieuville told TV station Mayotte la 1ère. French President Emmanuel Macron said late Monday on X that he planned to travel to Mayotte “in the coming days to support our fellow citizens, civil servants and the emergency services that have been mobilized.” He added that he would declare a national mourning period. Earlier Monday evening, acting interior minister Bruno Retailleau said that it was impossible to assess the death toll, saying that it was “clear that the island is totally devastated.” The worst damage was to the informal settlements and shacks that are found across Mayotte, both Bieuville and Retailleau said. “There is nothing left,”﻿ Retailleau said. Of the official death toll, Bieuville said: “This figure is not plausible when you see the images of the slums.” Aerial footage from France’s military showed villages reduced to rubble. These neighborhoods are home to many of the roughly 100,000 undocumented migrants who live in Mayotte, according to France’s interior ministry. Located about 5,000 miles from Paris, Mayotte is the poorest place in the European Union and has struggled with unemployment, violence and a deepening migration crisis. In recent decades, tens of thousands of people from neighboring Comoros and Madagascar have come to Mayotte seeking better economic conditions and access to the French welfare system. The extent of the damage from the storm, which wrecked roads and communications networks, and the prevalence of undocumented migrants living in informal dwellings have hindered search and rescue efforts and made it difficult to ascertain the true death toll. About two thirds of the island is currently unreachable, Estelle Youssouffa, member of parliament for the first constituency of Mayotte told BMFTV. “We must not confuse the villages that are cut off from communication (…) and the shanty towns, where there is very little chance of there being survivors. Everything has been razed,” Yousouffa said. Antoine Piacenza, who works in a middle school in Mamoudzou, told BFMTV that many of his students, who are undocumented, chose not to evacuate ahead of the storm out of fear of being caught by the police. In recent years, France has flooded the island with thousands of police, tasked with deporting undocumented migrants and dismantling their settlements. Desperate family members took to social media to search for news of their loved ones after the storm. As of Monday morning, Mayotte had been almost entirely offline for over 36 hours, according to the website NetBlocks. “We have no electricity, no water, we’ve been in the dark for three days. It’s been three days and we haven’t seen any rescuers,” Fahar, a Mamoudzou resident, told BFMTV. France’s minister for everyday security, Nicolas Daragon, said on social media late Sunday the first military planes providing emergency aid to the cyclone-battered island had landed. Retailleau said that France had mobilized two naval ships and that they were hopeful that more flights would be able to enter the territory soon, noting that flights cannot land at night yet given how badly the airport was affected by the cyclone. France is “standing by their side with a helping hand,” Retailleau said of the Mayotte people. Meanwhile, hundreds of rescuers, firefighters and police have been sent to the territory from France and Reunion, the Associated Press reported. Cyclones, also known as typhoons and called hurricanes in North America, are enormous heat engines of wind and rain that feed on warm ocean water and moist air. Cyclone season in the southwest Indian Ocean typically runs from mid-November to the end of April, according to France’s weather agency. Scientists say climate change, driven by humans burning fossil fuels, is making tropical cyclones more destructive as hotter oceans fuel them with more energy and warmer air can hold more moisture, which is wrung out in the form of torrential rain. In 2019, two powerful cyclones,Idai and Kenneth, pummeled Mozambique over a period of two months, killing hundreds and leaving millions in need of humanitarian assistance. Chad Youyou, a resident in Hamjago in the north of Mayotte, posted videos to Facebook showing flattened trees and extensive damage to his village, the Associated Press reported. “Mayotte is destroyed … we are destroyed,” he said.\n",

            "Cyclone Chido caused extensive damage on the French territory of Mayotte in the Indian Ocean, leaving several people dead, officials said Saturday, as the storm roared toward the east coast of Africa. French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said a “very provisional” tally shows there are at least “a few people” who have died. He said he would not yet provide any precise numbers of people killed and injured given rescuers have not yet been able to assess the situation on the ground. “We’re afraid the toll will be high, but for the moment I can’t give any figures,” Retailleau told reporters following an emergency meeting at the interior ministry in Paris. “The island seems devastated.” Chido brought winds in excess of 220 kph (136 mph), according to the French weather service, ripping metal roofs off houses in Mayotte, which has a population of just over 300,000 spread over two main islands that lie about 800 kilometers (497 miles) off Mozambique. France’s new Prime Minister François Bayrou, whowas appointed Friday, said public facilities have been “severely damaged or destroyed” including at the prefecture, the hospital and the airport. He said many people living in precarious shacks in slum areas have faced “very serious risks.” French President Emmanuel Macron said he was closely monitoring the situation. “Our island is being hit by the most violent and destructive cyclone since 1934. Many of us have lost everything,” Mayotte prefect François-Xavier Bieuville said in a Facebook post Saturday. He said the highest alert had been lifted so that rescuers can help after the worst of the cyclone had passed. The French Interior Ministry said 1,600 police and gendarmerie officers have been deployed to “help the population and prevent potential looting.” Some 110 rescuers and firefighters sent to Mayotte from France and the nearby territory of Reunion have been deployed and an additional reinforcement of 140 people will be sent on Sunday. France’s poorest island, Mayotte has previously struggled with drought and underinvestment. French Transport Minister François Durovray said Mayotte airport was “badly damaged, particularly the control tower” by the cyclone in a message on X. He said infrastructure on the island had been heavily impacted and air traffic will first be reopened to military aircraft only. Ships are being used to provide supplies. Mayotte is still under red alert for the ordinary population and people were asked to “remain confined in a solid shelter,” prefect Bieuville said. Only emergency and security services were allowed to go out. Local broadcaster Mayotte la 1ere said that thousands of homes were without power, tin huts and other small structures had been blown away and many trees had been blown over. The nation of Comoros, a group of islands north of Mayotte, also was being battered by Chido and the highest alert had been announced in some areas. Authorities said they were concerned for a group of 11 fishermen who had gone out to sea on Monday and had not been heard from. Comoros authorities have ordered all ships to remain anchored in harbors and have closed the main airport and government offices. Schools were ordered closed on Friday so that people could prepare for the cyclone. Chido was expected to continue its eastern trajectory and hit Mozambique on the African mainland late Saturday or early Sunday, forecasters said. Mozambique’s disaster agency has warned that 2.5 million people might be affected in the northern provinces of Cabo Delgado and Nampula. And further inland, landlocked Malawi and Zimbabwe were also preparing. Malawi’s Department of Disaster Management Affairs said it was expecting flooding in some parts and urgently advised some people to move to higher ground. In Zimbabwe, authorities said some people should prepare for evacuation. December through to March is cyclone season in the southeastern Indian Ocean and southern Africa has been pummeled by a series of strong ones in recent years. Cyclone Idai in 2019 killed more than 1,300 people in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Cyclone Freddy left more than 1,000 dead across several countries last year. The cyclones bring the risk of flooding and landslides, but also stagnant pools of water may later spark deadly outbreaks of the waterborne cholera disease — as happened in the aftermath of Idai — as well as dengue fever and malaria. Studies say the cyclones are getting worse because of climate change. They can leave poor countries in southern Africa, which contribute a tiny amount to climate change, having to deal with large humanitarian crises.\n",

Her gallery, Mariane Ibrahim,confirmed her deathvia email, adding that it was due to natural causes. O’Grady became an artist comparatively late in life, when she was in her early 40s, and then worked for another two decades in relative obscurity before her work started coming to widespread attention in the early 2000s. She was included in the landmark 2007 exhibition “WACK!: Art and the Feminist Revolution” at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles and the 2010 Whitney Biennial in New York. In 2021, the Brooklyn Museum hosted a major retrospective, “Lorraine O’Grady: Both/And.” For the occasion the artist, then in her late 80s, debuted a new performance art persona that involved her donning a full suit of armor. “I thought that when I had the retrospective, there would be this great big moment when I would go into the galleries and see all of my work at the same time, in the same place, and have this big Aha!” shetold New York Magazinein 2021. “The engagement of the audience, which involves a back-and-forth of question-and-answer, is the thing that was missing.” Performance and back-and-forth questioning with an audience are hallmarks of the three projects O’Grady is arguably best known for — two under her own name, the other as a member of the anonymous feminist collective the Guerrilla Girls. In 1980, she premiered her most famous performance persona, Mlle Bourgeoise Noire, a figure clad in a dress made from 180 pairs of white gloves, during an opening at Just Above Midtown, a non-profit gallery championing Black artists’ work. After handing out white chrysanthemums to those in attendance, she slipped on a pair of white gloves, whipped herself with a white cat-o’-nine-tails and, before leaving, shouted a poem that ended: “Black art must take more risks!!!” (She would reprise the role the following year during an opening at the New Museum in New York for an exhibition that she had not been invited to show in, though she had been asked to participate in its education programming.) Then, in 1983, she entered a float into the annual African American Day Parade in Harlem. It featured a large, gilded and empty frame, and was accompanied by a troupe of 15 Black performers hired by O’Grady. Each one carried their own frame, holding them up in front of spectators lining the parade route, other performers and even — in one indelible image of O’Grady wielding her frame — a New York Police Department officer. Images from that project, “Art Is…” entered the wider lexicon of visual culture as O’Grady’s career gained momentum in recent decades. In late 2020, avideoreleased by the Biden-Harris campaign celebrating its election victory reinterpreted the piece, with O’Grady’s blessing. The child of Jamaican immigrants, O’Grady was born in Boston on September 21, 1934. Her identity was shaped both by her Caribbean heritage and her family’s anomalous class position. Her parents had been upper- and middle-class in Jamaica, but were confined to working-class jobs after they moved to the US. She did not fit naturally with either the predominantly White working-class community in Boston’s Back Bay, where she spent most of her childhood, or with Boston’s upper-middle-class African American elite. “I always felt that nobody knew my story, but if there wasn’t room for my story, then it wasn’t my problem,” she told New York Magazine. “It was theirs.” Before finding art, O’Grady tried many pursuits and careers, first opting to study Spanish literature at Wellesley College before changing tracks to study economics. After graduating she briefly worked for the Department of Labor before becoming a fiction writer. She enrolled in the Iowa Writers’ Workshop at the University of Iowa, but never finished her studies there. She moved to Chicago and worked for a translation agency before starting her own, completing projects for clients including Encyclopedia Britannica and Playboy. In the early 1970s she moved to New York City and became a rock music critic, writing for The Village Voice and Rolling Stone. In the mid-1970s she started teaching literature at the School of Visual Art in New York. While cutting up an edition of The New York Times to make a gift, she began collaging together fragments of texts. These collages would become her first series, “Cutting Out the New York Times.” “The problem I always had was that no matter who I was with or what I did, I got bored pretty quickly,” O’Grady told New York Magazine. “This was something I knew I would never get bored with, because how can I get bored? I would always be learning, and I would never, ever master it. That was part of the appeal.” After that, though she continued to write — abookof her collected writings, edited by the scholar and critic Aruna D’Souza, was published by Duke University Press in 2020 — art-making became O’Grady’s primary activity. She also taught new generations of artists, taking on a full-time job at the University of California, Irvine, in the early 2000s. “I don’t think the average person who becomes an artist starts off thinking of it as anything other than self-expression,” O’Gradytold the Brooklyn Railin 2016. “That gets educated out of them gradually. ‘Self-expression’ is something that gets tamped down in graduate school in particular — teaching at UC Irvine, I watched people struggling against that, against having to learn how to fit into the market. I don’t know that the nature of art itself has changed; I do think the idea of an ‘art career’ has changed.” Defying the conventional ideas of an art career until the end, O’Grady had been busier than ever in recent years. Last year she left her longtime dealer Alexander Gray to join Mariane Ibrahim, a Chicago-based gallery with locations in Mexico City and Paris. At the time of her death, she was working on her first solo show with the gallery, at its French space, scheduled for spring 2025. “Lorraine O’Grady was a force to be reckoned with,” Ibrahim said in a statement. “Lorraine refused to be labeled or limited, embracing the multiplicity of history that reflected her identity and life’s journey. Lorraine paved a path for artists and women artists of color, to forge critical and confident pathways between art and forms of writing.” This past April, O’Grady won a prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship, which was to support a new performance art piece reviving an old character from her past work. And while the reception for her art changed drastically over the years, the work itself maintained an intellectual rigor, criticality and playfulness that spanned her performances, collages, photographic diptychs and series, writings and more. “I’m old-fashioned. I think art’s first goal is to remind us that we are human, whatever that is,” she told the Brooklyn Rail. “I suppose the politics in my art could be to remind us that we are all human. Art doesn’t change that much, actually. I’ve read lots of poetry from Ancient Egypt and Ancient Rome and they talk about the same things poets do today. Is anyone more down and dirty and at the same time more introspective than Catullus?” Read more stories from The Art Newspaperhere.\n",

            "A perfectly twirled bite of spaghetti hangs off a fork mid-air. Next to it, a bowl oframenand a katsudon — freshly cooked eggs and pork cutlet – fall fresh out of the pan. Plates are stacked high with colorful sashimi and elaborate parfaits. It’s a feast for the eyes — and the eyes alone. These are “shokuhin sampuru” — the highly realistic food replicas commonly displayed in front of restaurants in Japan, intended to lure customers inside. A familiar sight in Japan, a vast array of these replicas are now on display in London in an exhibition that is the first of its kind, according to Simon Wright, the show’s curator and director of programming atJapan House London. “Looks Delicious!” features replicas made by the Iwasaki Group, the first company dedicated to the production of these fake foods which remains today the largest producer in Japan. (The company needs to make on average one replica every 40 minutes in order to keep the business viable, according to Wright.) Its founder, Takizo Iwasaki, wasreportedly inspiredto create wax models of food from a childhood memory of seeing candlewax fall into a puddle and form into the shape of a flower. A version of Iwasaki’s first ever replica — modeled after an omelette his wife made — is on display at the exhibition, named “kinen omu,”or celebration omelette. Over time, Iwasaki developed a production method using wax and agar jelly molds, though now the company mainly uses PVC. However the origin story of food replicas more broadly is a “mess,” according to Nathan Hopson, a professor of Japanese at the University of Bergen who has studied the subject in-depth. Hopson told CNN in a video call that there are a myriad of theories as to how the replicas came to be introduced in Japanese culture. One popular explanation,according to Japan House, is that they were made to familiarize Western dishes to a “curious yet cautious” Japanese public who otherwise wouldn’t know what to expect if they made an order. Among the swaths of traditional Japanese food, the exhibit also features strikingly realistic renderings of bacon, eggs and grilled cheese. The exhibition’s centerpiece is a map of Japan made up of food replicas representing each of the country’s 47 prefectures. Each replica was specially commissioned and made by the Iwasaki Group, which created replicas of some dishes for the very first time. It wasn’t easy to choose just one dish per prefecture for Wright’s team, who started by consulting a list created by Japan’s Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, before also reaching out to people from the regions. “You start to discover that a lot of people have a lot of opinions on this,” Wright said. An exception was made for the northernmost prefecture of Hokkaido, the only one represented by two dishes: “kaisen-don,” a bowl of rice topped with seafood, and “ohaw,” a soup from the indigenous Ainu community. The Iwasaki Group had never made a replica of ohaw before, so the exhibition’s team had to ask the community to make them the dish, which was sent to Osaka overnight, photographed,and made into a replica the next day. Creating the impression of realistic liquids is one of the most difficult techniques to master in replica-making. Done right, the result is bowls of soup and glasses of wine which give the sense that they would spill over the table if mishandled by a curious visitor. There is a ‘hyper-realism’ to these foods, explained Wright, which is intended to trigger the prospective customer’s memory, imagination — and hopefully catch their eye. “They are there to attract people in an instant,” he said. “To try and lure them to have lunch or to have dinner there.” And importantly, people trust that the food they see on display will live up to the food they get in real life, with Hopson calling them a “promise.” “I can go into any place in Japan, in any town and city and know exactly what I’m going to get,” he said. But the replicas are more than marketing made pleasing to the eye. They serve a practical function, dating back to when they were introduced by Shirokiya, a major department store, in the aftermath of a devastating earthquake on Japan’s main island in 1923. The store was one of the first places to open in Tokyo after the earthquake and serviced the masses of people who could no longer cook for themselves at home, explained Hopson, who studied the company’s history. Rather than decide their order when they reached the store’s top-floor cafeteria, a new system was designed: window displays could give customers the opportunity to look at the food on offer while they waited in line. “It’s really about this management side, supply-side rationalization that’s very much part of creating a new, modern, capitalist success story,” said Hopson, who added that they really took off in the 1970s, or Japan’s ‘year-zero’ for fast food. Though they continue to be a common sight in Japan’s restaurant windows, the replicas are also evolving in their function. The exhibition shows how food replicas can be used for quality control in agriculture, food manufacturing and for nutritional purposes by displaying the ideal diet for a person with diabetes. The exhibition also gives visitors a chance to arrange their own bento box with the replica treats. Who said you shouldn’t play with your food? “Looks Delicious!” runs until February 15.

            "Israelwasted no timeafter Bashar al-Assad’s fall to bomb all the Syrian military assets it wanted to keep out ofthe rebels’hands – striking nearly 500 targets, destroying the navy, and taking out, it claims, 90% of Syria’s known surface-to-air missiles. But it is Israel’s capture of Syria’s highest peak, the Mount Hermon summit, that may prove among the most lasting prizes – though officials have insisted that its occupation is temporary. “This is the highest place in the region, looking upon Lebanon, upon Syria, Israel,” said Efraim Inbar, director of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security (JISS). “It’s strategically extremely important. There is no substitute for mountains.” The summit of Mount Hermon lies in Syria, in a buffer zone that separated Israeli and Syrian forces for fifty years until last weekend, when Israeli troops took control of it. Until Sunday, the summit was demilitarized and patrolled by UN peacekeepers – their highest permanent position in the world. Israel’s defense minister, Israel Katz, on Friday ordered the military to prepare for the harsh conditions of winter deployment. “Due to developments in Syria, it is of immense security importance to maintain our control over the summit of Mount Hermon,” he said in a statement. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has advanced beyond the summit, as far as Beqaasem, about 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) from the Syrian capital, according to Voice of the Capital, a Syrian activist group. CNN could not independently confirm that claim. An Israeli military spokesperson this week denied that forces were “advancing toward” Damascus. Israel captured the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau in southwestern Syria that abuts Mount Hermon, in the 1967 war and has occupied it since. Syria attempted to retake the territory in a surprise attack in 1973, but failed, and Israel annexed it in 1981. The occupation is illegal under international law, but the United States recognized Israel’s claim on the Golan during the Trump administration. Israel has for decades held some lower slopes of Mount Hermon, and even operatesa ski resortthere, but the peak remained in Syria proper. “We have no intention to intervene in Syria’s internal affairs,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video days after Israel bombed hundreds of Syrian targets and seized the demilitarized buffer zone. “But we certainly intend to do everything necessary to take care of our security.” Mount Hermon’s summit is a tremendous asset under Israel’s control. At 9,232 feet (2,814 meters), it is higher than any point in Syria or Israel, and second to only one peak in Lebanon. “People sometimes say in the age of missiles, land is not important – it’s simply untrue,” Inbar said. In an academic paper published in 2011, he wrote of the many advantages presented by Mount Hermon. “It enables the use of electronic surveillance deep into Syrian territory, giving Israel early-warning capacity in case of an impending attack,” he wrote. Advanced technological alternatives like airborne surveillance, he argued, was simply not comparable. “In contrast to an installation on a mountain, these cannot carry heavy equipment such as big antennas, and they can be shot down by anti-air missiles.” The peak is just over 35 kilometers (about 22 miles) from Damascus, which means that control of its Syrian foothills – also now in IDF hands – put the Syrian capital within range for artillery cannons. The Syrian rebel leader Mohammad al-Jolani on Saturday accused Israel of crossing “the lines of engagement” with its actions in Syria, while a group of the country’s neighbors called on Israel to withdraw its forces from all Syrian territories. After meeting in Aqaba with officials from Turkey, Iraq, Egypt, and the European Commission, Jordan’s Deputy Prime Minister Ayman Safadi accused Israel of trying to exploit a power vacuum in Syria. Safadi warned that the country’s stability was a “pillar of the region’s security” and that if Israel did not respect Syrian sovereignty it risked “an explosion of the situation. Israel’s Netanyahu, meanwhile, has insisted his “hand is extended” to the new government in Syria. But in the post-October 7 world, he and other national security heavyweights have made clear they are not going to take any chances. “Mostly, it’s a comfort for us,” retired Brigadier General Israel Ziv said of Israel’s operations in Syria. “We have learned what happened in other countries when you have a terror organization that captures military equipment.” Netanyahu has also insisted that the occupation is temporary. “Israel will not permit jihadi groups to fill that vacuum and threaten Israeli communities on the Golan Heights with October 7 style attacks,” he said. His criteria for withdrawing, he said, was a Syrian force “that is committed to the 1974 agreement can be established and security on our border can be guaranteed.” It is unclear when that may be achieved. Whether the military withdraws “is a political decision,” Inbar said. “The military would love to stay there.”\n",
            "https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/europe/georgia-president-vote-mikheil-kavelashvili-intl/index.html\n",
            "Georgian lawmakers voted in a far-right former soccer star as the country’s next president on Saturday, deepening tensions between the pro-Russian government and pro-Western opposition amid mounting popular anger over the former’s decision to halt European Union accession talks. Mikheil Kavelashvili, 53, is a former MP for the ruling Georgian Dream party and played for the English soccer team Manchester City during the 1990s. He was the only candidate in the running. For the first time, the president was chosen not by a national election, but in parliament by a direct ballot of a 300-member electoral college made up of MPs and representatives of local government. Because the four main opposition groups have boycotted parliament since October’s disputed election, Kavelashvili was a shoo-in to win. In total there were 225 electors present for the vote, and 224 voted for Kavelashvili, who was the only candidate nominated, Reuters reported. He will be inaugurated on December 29, the news agency said. Georgian presidents holdlargely ceremonial powers. Kavelashvili is a hardline critic of the West and his upcoming presidency will no doubt exacerbate divisions between pro-Kremlin forces and pro-EU protesters, many of whom who have camped out in Tbilisi for the past 16 nights following the government’s decision to halt talks on joining the EU. Tensions have been brewing for months in the South Caucasus nation of 3.7 million people, where critics accuse the ruling Georgian Dream party of following increasingly authoritarian, pro-Russia policies in a turn away from the West that has tempered hopes for Georgia’s long-promised path to EU membership. Georgia’s Prime Minister, Irakli Kobakhidze, congratulated Kavelashvili at a briefing following the vote, while also describing the outgoing president, Salome Zourabichvili, as an “agent” of unspecified foreign powers, according to Reuters. Meanwhile, Zourabichvili, a pro-Western figure who has joined the opposition protesters, said the presidential vote made “a mockery of democracy.” Before the vote, she vowed to remain in office despite the result, insisting she holds the only legitimate institution left in Georgia. “I’m here and will remain – standing together with everyone!” Zourabichvili said late Friday. It is not clear how Georgian Dream will respond if Zourabichvili refuses to leave office. In an interview with CNN in October, Zourabichvili downplayed fears about her safety, saying her future “is not as important as the future of Georgia.” Critics have questioned Kavelashvili’s competence for the role, pointing to his background in sport rather than politics. He entered politics in 2016 after he was disqualified from seeking the leadership of the Georgian football federation because he has no higher education. Natalie Sabanadze, Georgia’s former ambassador to the EU, told CNN that Kavelashvili is “absolutely not qualified” and that his selection was taken by many Georgians as “an insult to the country.” “This was not just a nomination of a puppet who obviously cannot think for himself, but I think it was also a signal to Europe that… we’ll have a president which is completely opposed to the Western values,” said Sabanadze. Georgia has slid into crisis since a disputed election in October. Georgian Dream – already 12 years in office – claimed victory, but observers say the vote was neither free nor fair. The European Parliament has called for a rerun. Despite claiming earlier that his party was committed to joining the EU, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidzeannouncedon November 28 that his government would suspend accession talks with the EU, which some 80% of Georgians support joining. Meanwhile, Georgia’s relations with the EU have deteriorated sharply in recent months as Brussels has alleged that the government had resorted to authoritarian measures and adopted pro-Russian stances. Pro-EU Georgian citizens have demonstrated outside the parliament building in Tbilisi every night since November 28, despite police and masked “special forces” meting out acatalogue of violenceagainst dozens of protesters. CNN asked the country’s Ministry of Internal Affairs for comment on the alleged brutality by the masked forces but did not receive a response. Georgia’s interior ministry has said that more than 150 officers have been injured during the protests, Reuters reported. Early Saturday, protesters took to the streets for a 17th day. Some were seen kicking soccer balls, seeming to mock the expected appointment of Kavelashvili. This is a developing story and will be updated.\n",
            "https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/15/middleeast/netanyahu-trump-call-gaza-syria-intl-latam/index.html\n",
            "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that he had a “very warm” phone call with US President-elect Donald Trump, during which they spoke about the need for Israel’s victory in itswar on Hamasin Gaza and its stance on Syria. In a video statement, Israel’s leader said he discussed a range of issues with Trump during the call on Saturday evening, including Israel’s commitment to preventing Lebanon-based Hezbollah from rearming and Israel’s conflict with Hamas, which has killed nearly 45,000 Palestinians in the besieged Gaza strip. The leaders also spoke of the need to bring home the remaining hostages in Gaza, Netanyahu said. “I discussed all of this again last night with my friend, US President-elect Donald Trump,” Netanyahu said. “It was a very friendly, very warm and very important conversation. We spoke about the need to complete Israel’s victory, and we also spoke at length about the efforts we are making to free our hostages.” Hamas and other groups are believed to still be holding 100 hostages in Gaza, including seven Americans. All but four of the hostages were captured during Hamas’ attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. Netanyahu said that Israel continues to “work tirelessly to bring our hostages home, both the living and the dead. And I add, the less we talk about it, the better, and so with God’s help, we will succeed.” CNN has reached out to the Trump transition team for comment. Regarding Syria, where a rebel coalition overthrew the regime of President Bashar al-Assad last weekend following a lightning advance through the country, Netanyahu said that Israel had “no interest in a conflict” the country, but would adjust its policy according to the “emerging reality on the ground.” His latest comments come after Israeli forces following Assad’s fall took control of a long-standingbuffer zonethat had separated Israeli and Syrian forces for decades – a move the rebels now in charge of Syria and some of the country’s neighbors have criticized. Israeli officials have said the measure is temporary and Netanyahu has previously insisted Israel has “no intention” of intervening in Syria’s internal affairs. However, in his statement Sunday, the Israeli leader noted that Syria had “allowed Iran to arm Hezbollah through its territory” and said Israel was committed to preventing the militant group from rearming. “This is an ongoing test for Israel, we must meet it – and we will meet it. I say to Hezbollah and Iran in no uncertain terms – to prevent you from harming us, we will continue to act against you as much as necessary, in every arena and at any time,” he said. Israel reached a ceasefire agreement with Hezbollah in November after a 13-month conflict largely fought along Israel’s border with Lebanon which saw Israel kill a string of high-ranking Hezbollah commanders. Continuing tit-for-tat strikes have put strain on  the deal. Israel’s control of the buffer zone has added to tensions with Syria over its decades-long presence in the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau in southwestern Syria that Israel has occupied since a war in 1967. Syria attempted to retake the territory in a surprise attack in 1973, but failed, and Israel annexed it in 1981. Since the fall of Assad last week, the Israeli military has also taken control of Mount Hermon, which abuts the Golan Heights and lies within the buffer zone that had previously separated the two sides’ troops. Despite Israel’s insistence the move is temporary, several Arab states have accused Israel of exploiting instability in Syria to execute a land grab, while the rebel coalition now in charge of Syria has accused it of “crossing the lines of engagement.” Adding to those tensions, the Israeli government on Sunday approved a plan by Netanyahu to expand settlements in the occupied Golan Heights, according to a statement from the prime minister’s office. “In light of the war and the new front against Syria, and out of a desire to double the population of the Golan Heights, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today submitted for government approval the first amendment to the plan to encourage demographic growth in the Golan Heights and Katzrin Heights,” the statement said. Katzrin is an Israeli settlement in the Golan. The plan “will assist the Golan Regional Council in absorbing the new residents who will arrive,” the statement added. “Strengthening the Golan Heights is strengthening the state of Israel, and it is especially important at this time. We will continue to hold on to it, make it flourish, and settle it,” Netanyahu said, according to the statement. The occupation is illegal under international law, but the United States recognized Israel’s claim on the Golan during the Trump administration in 2019. Israel does not view its presence in the Golan as settlements. Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar condemned the plan to expand the Golan settlement. Qatar said it considered the expansion plan a “blatant violation of international law” and a new aggression on Syrian territories; Saudi Arabia said the move would derail Syria’s chances of restoring security and stability.\n"
